The Nectar of Devotion is a unique
spiritual text that explains the devo­
tional science of bhakti-yoga, or Kr�Qa
consciousness. Astonishingly intimate
in its detailed descriptions of the lov­
ing

relationships between

Lord

Sri

Kr�Qa and His devotees, it is at the same
time practical, authoritative and philo­
sophically substantial. It is a summary
study of Bhakti-rasarhrta-sindhu, which
was written in Sanskrit over 400 years
ago by the great philosopher-devotee

S rila Rupa Gosvami Prabhupada, and
it contains hundreds of quotes from
such

important Vedic literatures as

Bhagavad-glta, Srlmad-Bhagavatam, the
Upani�ads,

Mahabharata

and

the

Pura(las.
The Nectar of Devotion has been
called the "lawbook of

Kr�Qa con­

sciousness," for it is the text which
guides the devotees of the Hare Kr�r;Ja
movement in the details of their daily
lives. It elaborately explains the philo­
sophical background behind the many
rules and regulations that devotees of
Kr�r;Ja voluntarily follow, and it probes
deeply into the thoughts and emotions
that motivate a Kr�11a conscious devo­
tee.
Most importantly,

The Nectar of

Devotion goes beyond the limitations
of both empty religious sentiment and
dry, impersonal philosophy. It brings
the reader to a factual understanding
of the eternal activities of the spiritual
world and offers practical step-by-step
instructions

which

can

enable

the

serious student to actually enter into
these pastimes, in a personal, face-to­
face loving relationship with Kr�l)a,
the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Preface

The Nectar of Devotion is a summary study of Bhakti-rasamrta­

sindhu, which was written in Sanskrit by Srila Riipa Gosvami Prabhu­

pada. He was the chief of the six Gosvam.ls who were the direct
disciples of Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu. When he first met Lord

Caitanya, Srila Riipa GosvamiPrabhupada was engaged as a minister in

the Mohammed�n government of Bengal. He and his brother Sanatana

were then named Sakara Mallik and Dabir Khas respectively, and

they held responsible posts as ministers of Nawab Hussain Shah. At
that time, five hundred years ago, the Hindu society was very ri gid,

and if a member of the briihmarza caste accepted the service of a
Mohammedan ruler he was at once rej ected from briihmarza society.

That was the position of the two brothers, Dabir Khas and Sakara

Mallik. They belonged to the highly situated siirasvata-briihmarza
community, but they were ostracized due to their acceptance of
ministerial posts in the government of Hussain Shah. It is the grace of
Lord Caitanya that He accepted these two exalted personalities as His

disciples and raised them to the position of gosviimis, the highest

position of brahminical culture. Similarly, Lord Caitanya accepted
Haridasa Thakur as His disciple although he happened to be born of

a Mohammedan family, and Lord Caitanya later on made him the

iicarya of the chanting of the holy name of the Lord: Hare Kr9!1a,

Hare Kr9!1a, Kn!la Kr9!1a, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama
Rama, Hare Hare.

Lord Caitanya's principle is universal. Anyone who knows the

science of Kr9!1a and is engaged in the service of the Lord is accepted

as being in a higher position than a person born in the family of a

briihmar;w. That is the original principle accepted by all Vedic lit­

eratures, especially by the Bhagavad-g"ita and the Srimad-Bhiigavatam.
The principle

of

Lord

Caitanya's movement in

educating and

elevating everyone to the exalted post of a gosviimi is taught in

The Nectar of Devotion.

Lord Caitanya met the two brothers, Dabir Khas and Sakara

Mallik, in a village known as Ramakeli in the district of Maldah, and

after that meeting the brothers decided to retire from government

service and join Lord Caitanya. Sakara Mallik, who was later to

become Rupa Gosvami, retired from his post and collected all the
money he had accumulated during his service. It is described in the

Caitanya-caritiimrta that his accumulated savings in gold coins equalled

millions of dollars and filled a large boat. He divided the money in

a very exemplary manner which should be followed by devotees in

particular and by humanity in general. Fifty percent of his accumu­

lated wealth was distributed to the Kr��a conscious persons, namely

the briihmar;ws and the Vai§r-avas; twenty-five percent was distributed
to relatives; ahd twenty-five percent was kept against emergency

expenditures and personal difficulties.· Later on when Dabir Khas

also proposed to retire, the Nawah was very much agitated and put
him into jail. But Dabir Khas, who was later to become Srila Sanatana

Gosvami, took advantage of his brother's personal money, which had

been deposited with a village banker, and escaped from the prison of

Hussain Shah. In this way both ·brothers joined Lord Caitanya
Mahaprabhu.

Rupa Gosvami first met Lord Caitanya at Prayag (Allahabad,

India), and on the Dasasvamedha bathing ghat of that holy city the
Lord instructed him continually for ten days. The Lord particularly
instructed Rupa Gosvami on the science of Kr��a consciousness.

These teachings of Lord Caitanya to Snl.a Rupa Gosvami Prabhupada

are narrated in our book Teachings of Lord Caitanya.

Later, Srila Rupa Gosvami Prabhupada elaborated the teachings of

the Lord with profound knowledge of revealed scriptures and authori­

tative references from various Vedic literatures. Srila Srinivasa Acarya
describes in his prayers to the six Gosvamis that they were all highly

learned scholars, not only in Sanskrit but also in foreign languages

Preface

such as Persian and Arabian. They very scrutinizingly studied all the

Vedic scriptures in order to establish the cult of Caitanya Mahaprabhu

on the authorized principles of Vedic knowledge. The present Krwa

consciousness movement is also based on the authority of Srila Riipa
GosvamiPrabhupada. We are therefore generally known as rilpiinugas,

or followers in the footsteps of Srila Riipa Gosvami Prabhupada. It is

only for our guidance that Srila Rupa Gosvami prepared his book

Bhakti-rasiimrta-sindhu, which is now presented in the form of The

Nectar of Devotion. Persons engaged in the KH:.;ta consciousness

movement may take advantage of this great literature and be very

solidly situated in Kr�:.;ta consciousness.

Bhakti means devotional service. Every service has some attractive

feature which drives the servitor progressively on and on. Every one
of us within this world is perpetually engaged in some sort of service,

and the impetus for such service is the pleasure we derive from it.

Driven by affection for his wife and children, a family man works

day and night. A philanthropist works in the same way for love of
the greater family, and a nationalist for the cause of his country

and countrymen. That force which drives the philanthropist, the

householder and the nationalist is called rasa, or a kind of mellow
(relationship) whose taste is very sweet. Bhakti-rasa is

a

mellow

different from the ordinary rasa enjoyed by mundane workers.

Mundane workers labor very hard day and night in order to relish
a certain kind of rasa which is understood as sense gtatification.

The relish or taste of the mundane rasa does not long endure, and

therefore mundane workers are always apt to change their position
of enjoyment. A businessman is not satisfied by working the whole

week; therefore, wanting a change for the weekend, he goes to a place

where he tries to forget his business activities. Then, after the weekend
is spent in forgetfulness, he again changes his position and resumes his

actual business activities. Material engagment means accepting a

particular status for some time and then changing it. This position

of changing back and forth is technically known as bhoga-tyiiga, which
means a position of alternating sense enjoyment and renunciation. A

living entity cannot steadily remain either in sense enjoyment or in
renunciation. Change is going on perpetually, and we cannot be happy

The Nectar of Devotion

Xll

in either state because of our eternal constitutional position. Sen_se
gratification does not endure for long, and it is therefore called
capala-sukha, or flickering happiness. For example, an ordinary family
man who works very hard day and night and is successful in giving

comforts to the members of his family thereby relishes a kind of
mellow, but his whole advancement of material happiness immedi­
ately terminates along with his body as soon as his life is over. Death
is therefore taken as the representative of God for the atheistic class

of men. The devotee realizes the presence of God by devotional

service, whereas the atheist realizes the presence of God in the shape
of death. At death everything is finished, and one has to begin a new

chapter of life in a new situation, perhaps higher or lower than the last
one. In any field of activity, political, social, national or international,

the result of .our actions will be finished with the end of life. That is
sure.

Bhakti-rasa, however, the mellow relished in the transcendental

loving service of the Lord, does not finish with the end of life. It
continues perpetually and is therefore called amrta, that which does

not die but exists eternally. This is confirmed in all Vedic literatures.
The Bhagavad-gitii says that a little advancement in bhakti-rasa can
save the devotee from the greatest danger, that of missing the

opportunity for human life. The rasas derived from our feelings in

social life, in family life, or in the greater family life of altruism,
philanthropism, nationalism, socialism, communism, etc., do not

guarantee that one's next life will be as a human being. We prepare
our next life by our actual activities in the present life. A living entity
is offered a particular type of body as a result of his action in the
present body. These activities are taken into account by a superior
authority known as daiva, or the authority of God. This daiva is

explained in the Bhagavad-gitii as the prime cause of everything, and

in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam it is stated that a man takes his next body

by daiva-netrel}a, which means by the supervision of the authority of

the Supreme. In an ordinary sense daiva is explained as destiny. Daiva

supervision gives us a body selected from 8,400,000 forms; the choice
does not depend on our selection, but is awarded to l;lS according to
our destiny.lf our body at present is engaged in the activities of Kr��a

Preface

xm

consciousness, then it is guaranteed that- we will have at least a human

body in our next life. A human being engaged in Kr��a consciousness,

even if unable to complete the course of bhakti-yoga, is allowed to

take birth in the higher division of human society so that he can
automatically further his advancement in KH�a consciousness. There­

fore, all bona fide activities in Kr��a consciousness are amrta, or
permanent. This is the subject matter of The Nectar of Devotion.

This eternal engagement in· bhakti-rasa can be understood by a

serious student upon studying The Nectar of Devotion. Adoption

of bhakti-rasa or Kr��a consciousness will immediately bring one

to an auspicious life free from anxieties and will bless one with
transcendental existence, thus minimizing the value of liberation.

Bhakti-rasa itself is sufficient to produce a feeling of liberation because

it attracts the attention of the Supreme Lord, Kr��a. Generally,

neophyte devotees are anxious to see Kr��a or God, but God cannot

be seen or known by our present materially blunt senses. The process
of devotional service as it is recommended in The Nectar of Devotion

will gradually eievate one from the material condition of life to the

spiritual status, wherein the devotee becomes purified of all designa­
tions. The senses can then become uncontaminated, being constantly

in touch with bhakti-rasa. When the purified s-enses are employed in
the service of the Lord, one becomes situated in bhakti-rasa life,

and any action performed for the satisfaction of Kr��a in this

transcendental bhakti-rasa stage of life can be relished perpetually.

When one is thus engaged in devotional service, all varieties of rasas or

mellows turn into eternity. In the beginning one is trained according

to the principles of regulation under the guidance of the iiciirya or

spiritual master, and gradually, when one is elevated, devotional

service becomes automatic and spontaneous eagerness to serve Kr��a.

There are twelve kinds of rasas, as will be explained in this book, and

by renovating our relationship with Kr��a in five primary rasas we
can live eternally in full knowledge and bliss.

The basic principle of the living condition is that we have a general

propensity to love someone. No one can live without loving someone

else. This propensity is present in every living being. Even an animal

like a tiget has this loving propensity at least in a dormant stage, and it

is certainly present in the human beings. The missing point, however,
is where to repose our love so that everyone can become happy. At
the present moment the human society teaches one to love his
country or family or his personal self, but there is no information
where to repose the loving propensity so that everyone can become
happy. That missing point is Kr�!la, and The Nectar of Devotion
teaches us how to stimulate our original love for Kr�!la and how to
be situated in that position where we can enjoy our blissful life.
In the primary stage a child loves his parents, then his brothers and

sisters, and as he daily grows up he begins to love his family, society,
community, country, nation, or even the whole human society. But
the loving propensity is not satisfied even by loving all human society;
that loving propensity remains imperfectly fulfilled until we know
who is the supreme beloved. Our love can be fully satisfied only when
it is reposed in Kr�!la. This theme is the sum and substance of The
Nectar of Devotion, which teaches us how to love Krwa in five
.
different transcendental mellows.

Our loving propensity expands just as a vibration of light or air
expands, but we do not know where it ends. The Nectar of Devotion
teaches us the science of loving every one of the living entities
perfectly by the easy method of loving Kr�!la· We have failed to create
peace and harmony in human society, even by such great attempts as
the United Nations, because we do not know the right method. The

method is very simple, but one has to understand it with a cool head.

The Nectar of Devotion teaches all men how to perform the simple

and natural m.ethod of loving Kr�tJ.a, the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. If we learn how to love Kr�!la, then it is very easy to
immediately and simultaneously love every living being. It is like
pouring water on the root of a tree or supplying food to. one's
stomach. The method of pouring water on the root of a tree or
supplying .foodstuffs to the stomach is universally scientific and
practical, as every one of us has experiencea. EvP,ryone knows well
that when we eat something, or in . other words when we put
foodstuffs in the stomach, the energy created by such action is

immediately distributed throughout the whole body. Similarly, when

we pour water on the root, the energy thus created is immediately

Preface

.XV

distributed throughout the entirety of even the largest tree. It is not
possible to water the tree part by part, nor is it possible to feed the
different parts of the body separately. The Nectar of Devotion will
teach us how to turn the one switch that will immediately brighten
everything, everywhere. One who does not know this method is miss­
ing the point of life.
As far as material necessities are concerned, the human civilization
at the present moment is very much advanced in living comfortably,
but still we are not happy because we are missing the point. The
material comforts of life alone are not sufficient to make us happy.
The vivid example is America: the richest nation of the world, having
all facilities for material comfort, is producing a class of men com­
pletely confused and frustrated in life. I am appealing herewith to
such confused men to learn the art of devotional service as directed
in The Nectar of Devotion, and I am sure that the fire of material
existence burning within their hearts will be immediately extin­
guished. The root cause of our dissatisfaction is that our dormant
loving propensity has not been fulfilled despite our great advancement
in the materialistic way of life. The Nectar of Devotion will give us
practical hints how we can live in this material world perfectly engaged
in devotional service and thus fulfill all our desires in this life and the
next. The Nectar of Devotion is not presented to condemn any way of
materialistic life, but the attempt is to give information to religionists,
philosophers and people in general how to love Kr��a. One may live
without material discomfiture, but at the same time he should learn
the art of loving Kr��a. At the present moment we are inventing so
many ways to utilize our propensity to love, but factually we are
missing the real point, Kr��a. We are watering all parts of the tree but
missing the tree's root. We are trying to keep our body fit by all
means, but we are neglecting to supply foodstuffs to the stomach.
Missing Krwa means missing one's self also. Real self-realization and
realization of Kr��a go together simultaneously. For example, seeing
oneself in the morning means seeing the sunrise also; without seeing
the sunshine no one can see himself. Similarly, unless one has realized
Kr��a there is no question of self-realization.
The Nectar of Devotion is specifically presented for persons who

my sincere thanks to all my friends and disciples who are helping me

to push forward the Kr�l}a consciousness movement in the Western

Introduction

Invoking auspiciousness: Lord Sri Kr��a is the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, the cause of all causes, the reservoir of all rasas, or rela­
tionships, which are called neutrality (passive adoration), servitorship,
friendship, parenthood, conjugal love, comedy, compassion, fear, 1..
chivalry, ghastliness, wonder and devastation. He is the supreme at­
tractive form, and by His universal and transcendental attractive
features He has captivated all the gopis, headed by Taraka, Palika,
Syama, Lalita, and ultimately, Srimati Radhara�i. Let His Lordship's
grace be on us so that there may not be any hindrance in the execu­
tion of this duty of writing The Nectar of Devotion, impelled by His
Divine Grace Sri Srimad Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Gosvami Prabhu­
pada.
Let. me offer my respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of Srila
Riipa Gosvami Prabhupada and of Sril� Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati
GosvamiPrabhupada,by whose inspiration I have been engaged in the
matter of compiling this summary study of Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu.
This is the sublime science of devotional service as propounded by
Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu, who appeared 500 years ago in West Ben­
gal, India, to propagate the movement of Kr�tla consciousness.
Srila Riipa Gosvami begins his great book by offering his respect­
ful obeisances unto Sri Sanatana Gosvami, who is his elder brother
and spiritual master, and he prays that Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu may
be very pleasing to him. He further prays that by residing in that
ocean of nectar he may always feel transcendental pleasure in the
service of Radha and Kr��a.
Let us offer our respectful obeisances to all the great devotees and

acaryas (holy teachers), who are compared with sharks in the great

ocean of nectar and who do not care for the various rivers of libera­

tion. Impersonalists are very fond of merging into the supreme, like

rivers that come down and merge into the ocean. The ocean can be

compared with liberation and the rivers with all the different paths
of liberation. The impersonalists are dwelling in the river water,
which eventually comes to mix with the ocean. They have no infor­

mation, however, that within the ocean, as within the river, there are

innumerable aquatic living entities. The sharks who dwell in the

ocean do not care for the rivers which are gliding down into it. The
devotees eternally live in the ocean of devotional service, and they
do not care for the rivers. In other words, those who are pure devo­

tees always remain in the ocean of transcendental loving service to

the Lord and have no business with the other processes, which are
compared to the rivers that only gradually come to the ocean.

Srila Riipa Gosvami prays to his spiritual master, Srila Sanatana Go­

svami, for the protection of Bhakti-rasiimrta-sindhu-the Ocean of

the Pure Nectar of Devotional Service-from the argumentative logi ­

cians who unnecessarily meddle in the science of service to the Lord.

He compares their arguments and logic to volcanic eruptions in the

midst of the ocean. In the midst of the ocean such volcanic eruptions

can do very little harm, and similarly, those who are against devo­

tional service to the Lord and who put forward many philosophical
theses about the ultimate transcendental realization cannot disturb
this great ocean of devotional service.

The author of Bhakti-rasiimrta-sindhu, Srila Riipa Gosvami, very

humbly submits that he is j ust trying to spread Kr�!la consciousness

all over the world, although he humbly thinks himself unfit for this

work. That should be the attitude of all preachers of the Kr�!la con­

sciousness movement, following in the footsteps of Srila Riipa Go­

svami. We should never think of ourselves as great preachers, but
should always consider that we are simply instrumental to the pre­

vious iiciiryas, and simply by following in their footsteps we may be

able to do something for the benefit of suffering humanity.

Bhakti-rasiimrta-sindhu is divided into four parts, j ust as the ocean

I

I

I

is sometimes divided into four parts, and there are different sections

Introduction

XlX

within each of these four divisions. Originally in Bhakti-rasiimrta­

sindhu, the ocean is divided like the watery ocean into east, west,

north and south, while the sub-sections within these different divi­
sions �re called waves. As in the ocean there arc always different

waves, either on the eastern side, the western side, the northern side
or the southern side, so similarly Bhakti-rasiimrta-sindhu has differ­

ent waves. In the first part there are four waves, the first being a
general description of devotional service. The second concerns the

regulative principles for executing devotional service, and the third

wave devotional service in ecstasy. In the fourth is the ultimate goal,
love of God. These will be explicitly described along with their dif­

ferent symptoms.

The authorized description of bhakti, or devotional service, follow­

ing in the footsteps of previous iiciiryas, can be summarized in the

following statement by Srila Rupa Gosvam1: "First-class devotional

service is known by one's tendency to be fully engaged in Kr9!la con­

sciousness, serving the Lord favorably." The purport is that one may

also be in Kr9!la consciousness unfavorably, but that

cannot be

counted as pure devotional service. Pure devotional service should be

free from the desire for any material benefit or for sense gratification,

t

as these desires are cultivated through fruitive activities and philo­
sophical speculation. Generally, people are engaged in different activi­

ties to get some material profit, while most philosophers are engaged

in proposing transcendental realization through volumes of word jug­

glery and speculation. Pure devotional service must always be free
from such fruitive activities and philosophical speculations. One has

to learn Kr9�a consciousness or pure devotional service from the

authorities by spontaneous loving service.

'J=.his _devotional service is a sort of cultivation. It is not simply in­

action for people who like to be inactive or devote their time to

silent meditation. There arc many different methods for people who
want this, but cultivation of Kr9�a consciousness is different. The

particular word used by Srila Rupa Gosvam1 in this connection is

may be divided into two classes: one class may be for achieving a
certain goal, and the other may be for avoiding some unfavorable
circumstance. In Sanskrit, these activities are called pravrtti and
nivrtti-positive and negative action. There are many examples of
negative action. For instance, a diseased person has to be cautious and
take medicine in order to avoid some unfavorable illness.
Those who are cultivating spiritual life and executing devotional
service are always engaged in activity. Such activity can be performed

with the body or with the mind. Thinking, feeling and willing are all
activities of the mind, and when we will to do something, the activity

comes to be manifest by the gross bodily senses. Thus, in our mental
activities we should always try to think of Krwa and try to plan how
to please Him, following in the footsteps of the great iiciiiyas and the
personal spiritual master. There are activities of the body, activities
of the different senses and activities of speech. A Kr��a conscious
person engages his words in preaching the glories of the Lord. This is
called kirtana. And by his mind a Kr��a conscious person always
thinks of the activities of the Lord-as He is speaking on the battle­
field of Kuruk�etra or engaging in His various pastimes at V rndavana
with His devotees. In this way one can always think of the activities
and pastimes of the Lord. This is the mental culture of Kr��a con­
sciOusness.
Similarly, we can offer many services with our bodily activities. But
all such activities must be in relationship with Kr��a. This relationship

is established by con�ecting oneself with the bona fide spiritual mas­
ter who is the direct representative of Kr��a in disciplic succession.

Therefore, the execution of Kr��a conscious activities with the body

should be directed by the spiritual master and then performed with
faith. The connection with the spiritual master is called initiation.

From the date of initiation by the spiritual master, the connection

between

Krwa and a person cultivating Kr��a consciousness is

established. Without initiation by a bona fide spiritual master, the
actual connection with Kr��a consciousness is never performed.

This cultivation of Krwa consciousness is not material. The Lord

has generally three energies-namely, the external energy, the internal

,]

energy, and the marginal energy. The living entities are called mar­
ginal energy, and the material cosmic manifestation is the action of
the external or material energy. Then there is the spiritual world,
which is a manifestation of the internal energy. The living entities,
who are called marginal energy, perform material activities when
acting under the inferior external energy. And when they engage in
activities under the internal spiritual energy, their activities are called
Kr�pa conscious. This means that those who are great souls or great
devotees do not act under the spell of material energy, but act in­
stead under the protection of the spiritual energy. Any activities done
in devotional service or in Kr�pa consciousness are directly under the
control of spiritual energy.

In other words, energy is a sort of

strength, and this strength can be spiritualized by the mercy of both
the bona fide spiritual master and Kr�tta.
In the Caitanya-caritiimrta by Kr�ttadasa Kaviraja Gosvam'i, Lord
Caitanya states that it is a fortunate person who comes in contact
with a bona fide spiritual master by the grace of Kr�pa. One who is
serious about spiritual life is given by Kr�tta the intelligence to come
in contact with a bona fide spiritual master, and then by the grace of
the spiritual master one becomes advanced in Kr�tta consciousness.
In this way the whole jurisdiction of Kr�tta consciousness is directly
under the spiritual energy-Kr�tta and the spiritual master. This has
nothing to do with the material world. When we speak of Kr�rta we
refer to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, along with His many
expansions. He is expanded by His plenary parts and parcels, His dif­
�

.:.

ferentiated parts and parcels and His different energies. Kr�tta, in
other words, means everything and includes everything. Generally,
however, we should understand Kr�tta to mean Kr�tta and His per­
sonal expansions. Krwa expands Himself as Baladeva, Sarikar�atta,
Vasudeva, Aniruddha, Pradyumna, Rama, Nrsimha and Varaha, as
well as many other incarnations and innumerable Vi�ttu expansions.
These are described in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam to be as numerous as the

uncountable waves. So Kr�tta includes all such expansions, as well

as His pure devotees. In the Brahma-samhitii it is stated that Kr�tta's
expansions are all complete in eternity, blissfulness and cognizance.

The Nectar of Devotion

Devotional service means to prosecute Kr9!1-a conscious activities
which are favorable to the transcendental pleasure of the Supreme
Lord Kr9!1-a, and any activities which are not favorable to the tran­
scendental favor of the Lord cannot be accepted as devotional service.
For example, great demons like Rava!la, Kamsa and Hira!lyakasipu
were always thinking of Kr9!1-a, but they were thinking of Him as their
enemy. This sort of thinking cannot be accepted as bhakti or Krwa
consciOusness.
The impersonalists sometimes misunderstand devotional service in
such a way that they divide Kr9!1-a from His paraphernalia and pas ­
times. For example, the Bhagavad-gitii is spoken on the battlefield of
Kuruk9etra, and the impersonalists say that although Kr9!1-a is of

i
Il l
I!

I

interest, the battlefield of Kuruk9etra isn't. The devotees, however,
also know that the battlefield of Kuruk9etra by itself has nothing to
do with their business, but in addition they know that "Kr9!1-a" does
not mean just Kr9!1-a alone. He is always with His associates and
paraphernalia. For instance,

if someone says,

"Give something to

eat to the man with the weapons," the eating process is done by the
man and not by the weapons. Similarly, in Kr9!1-a consciousness, a
devotee may be interested in the paraphernalia and locations-such
as the battlefield of Kuruk9etra-which are associated with Kr9pa, but
he is not concerned with simply any battlefield. He is concerned with
Kr9pa-His speech, His instructions, etc. It is because Kr9pa is there
that the battlefield is so important.
This is the summary understanding of what Kr�!la consciousness is.
Without this understanding one is sure to misunderstand why the
devotees are interested in the battlefield of Kuruk9etra. One who is
interested in Kr9!1-a becomes interested in His different pastimes and
activities.
The definition of a pure devotee, as given by Riipa Gosvami in

Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, can be summarized thus: his service is favor­
able and is always in relation to Kr�pa. In order to keep the purity of
such Kr§!la conscious activities, one must be freed from all material
desires and philosophical speculation. Any desire except for the ser­
vice of the Lord is called material desire. And philosophical specula­
tion refers to the sort of speculation which ultimately arrives at a

111

l

Introduction

XXlll

conclusion of voidism or impersonalism. This conclusion is useless
for a Kr9�a conscious person. Only rarely by philosophical speculation

can one reach the conclusion of worshiping Vasudeva, Kr9p.a. This is
confirmed in the Bhagavad-gitii itself. The ultimate end of philo­

sophical speculation, then, must be Kr��a, with the understanding that
Kr9�a is everything, the cause of all causes, and that one should there­
fore surrender unto Him. If this ultimate goal is reached, then philo­
sophical advancement is favorable, but if the conclusion of philo­

sophical speculation is voidism or impersonalism, that is not bhakti.
Karma or fruitive activities are sometimes understood to be ritual­

istic activities. There are many persons who are very much attracted

by the ritualistic activities described in the Vedas. But if one becomes
attracted simply to ritualistic activities without understanding Kr9�a,

his activities are unfavorable to Kr9�a consciousness. Actually, Kr9�a
consciousness can be based simply on hearing, chanting, remembering,

etc. Described in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam are nine different processes,
besides which everything done is unfavorable to Kr9�a consciousness.
Thus, one should always be guarding against falldowns.

Srila Riipa Gosvam'i has also mentioned in this definition of bhakti

the word jfiiina-karmiidi. This karmiidi (fruitive work) consists of

activities which are unable to help one attain to pure devotional

service. Many fotrns of so-called renunciation are also not favorable
to Krwa conscious devotional service.

Srila Riipa Gosvam'i has also quoted a definition from the Niirada­

paficariitra, as follows: "One should be free from all material designa­

tions and must be cleansed of all material contamination by Kr9�a
consciousness. He should be restored to his pure identity, where he

engages his senses in the service of the proprietor of the senses." So
�

when our senses are engaged for the actual proprietor of the senses,

that is called devotional service. In our conditional state, our senses

are engaged in serving these bodily demands. When the same senses
are engaged in executing the order of Kr9�a, it is called bhakti.

As long as one identifies himself as belonging to a certain family, a

certain society or a certain person, he is said to be covered with

designations. When one is fully aware that he does not belong to any
family, society or country, but is eternally related to Kr9�a, he then

xxw

realizes that his energy. should be employed not in the interests of so­

called family, socie!:y or country, but in the interests of Kr��a:' This is

purity of purpose and the platform of pure devotional service in
Krsna consciousness .

I I Characteristics
of Pure Devotional Service

In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, Third Canto, 29th Chapter, lOth verse,

Srila Kapiladeva, while instructing His mother, has given the following

characteristics of pure devotional service: "My dear Mother, those

who are My pure devotees, and who have no desire for material

benefit or philosophical speculation, have their minds so much en­

gaged in My service that they are never interested in asking Me for
anything-except to be engaged in that service- They do not even beg

to live in My abode with Me."

There are five kinds of liberation, namely to become one with the

Lord, to live with the Supreme Lord on the same planet, to have the

same features as the Lord, to enjoy the same opulences as the Lord,

and to live as a companion of the Lord. A devotee, not to speak of
rejecting material sense gratification, does not even want any of the

five kinds of liberation. He is satisfied simply by discharging loving
service to the Lord. That is the characteristic of pure devotion.

In the above statement by Kapiladeva from the Srimad-Bhiigavatam,

the actual position of a pure devotee is described, and the primary

characteristics of devotional service are also defined. Further charac­

teristics· of devotional· service are described by Riipa Gosvami with

evidences from different scriptures. He states that th�re are six char-

acteristics of pure devotional service, which are as follows:

1) Pure devotional service brings immediate relief from all kinds
of
'

material distress.

2) Pure devotional service is the beginning of all auspiciousness.

3) Pure devotional service automatically puts one in transcenden­

tal pleasure.

2

The Nectar of Devotion
4) Pure devotional service is rarely achieved.
5) Those in pure devotional service deride even the conception of

liberation.
6) Pure devotional service is the only means to attract Kfgta.

Kr�tta is all-attractive, but pure devotional service attracts even
Him. This means that pure devotional service is even transcendentally

stronger than Krwa Himself, because it is Kr�tta's internal potency.

Relief from Material Distress

In the Bhagavad-gitii, the Lord says that one should surrender unto
Him, giving up all other engagements. The Lord also gives His word
there that He will protect such surrendered souls from the reactions
of all sinful activities. Srila Riipa Gosvami says that the distresses
from sinful activities are due both to the sins themselves and to sins

committed in our past lives. Generally, one commits sinful activities
due to ignorance. But ignorance is no excuse for evading the re­
action-sinful activities.

Sinful activities are of two kinds: those

which are mature and those which are not mature. The sinful activi­
ties for which we are suffering at the present moment are called
mature. The many sinful activities stored within us for which we

have not yet suffered are considered immature. For example, a man

may have committed criminal acts but is not yet arrested for them.

Now, as soon as he is detected, arrest -is awaiting him. Similarly, for

some of our sinful activities we are awaiting distresses in the future,

and for others, which are mature, we are suffering at the present
moment.

In this way there is a chain of sinful activities and their concomi­

tant distresses, and the conditioned soul is suffering life after life
due to these sins. He is suffering in the present life the results of

sinful activities from his past life, and he is meanwhile creating fur­

ther sufferings for his future life. Mature sinful activities are ex­
hibited if one is suffering from some chronic disease, if one is suf­

fering from some legal implication, if one is born irt a low and de­

graded family, or if one is uneducated or very ugly.

Characteristics of Pure Devotional Service

3

There are many results of past sinful activities for which we are

suffering at the present moment, and we may be suffering in the fu­

ture due to our present sinful activities. But all of these reactions to
sinful deeds

can

immediately be stopped if we take to Kns!la

consciousness. As evidence for this, Riipa Gosvami quotes from the

Srimad-Bhiigavatam, Eleventh Canto, 14th Chapter, 18th verse. This
verse is in connection with Lord Kr�pa's instruction to Uddhava,

where He says, "My dear Uddhava, devotional service unto Me is

just like a blazing fire which can burn into ashes unlimited fuel
supplied to it." The purport is that as the blazing fire can burn any

amount of fuel to ashes, so devotional service to the Lord in Kr�pa
consciousness can burn up all the fuel of sinful activities. For

example, in the Gitii Arjuna thought that fighting was a sinful ac­

tivity, but Krwa engaged him on the battlefield under His order, and

so the fighting became devotional service. Therefore, Arjuna was
not subjected to any sinful reaction.

Srila Riipa Gosvami quotes another verse from the Third Canto of

Srimad-Bhiigavatam,
addresses her

33rd Chapter, 6th verse, in which Devahiiti

son, Kapiladeva and says, "My deG\r Lord, there are

nine different kinds of devotional service, beginning from hearing

and chanting. Anyone who hears about Your pastimes, who chants
about Your glories, who offers You obeisances, who thinks of You

and, in this way, executes any of the nine kinds of devotional service
-even if he is born in a family of dog-eaters [the lowest grade of

mankind] -becomes immediately qualified to perform sacrifices."

As such, for anyone who is actually engaged in devotional service in

full Kg;pa consciousness, how is it possible that he has not become

purified? It is not possible. One who is engaged in Kr�pa conscious­

ness and devotional service has without doubt become freed from all

contaminations of material sinful activities. Devotional service there­

fore has the power to actually nullify all kinds of reactions to sinful

deeds. A -devotee is nevertheless always alert not to commit any sin­

ful activities; this is his specific qualification as a. devotee. Thus the

Srimad-Bhiigavatam states that by performing devotional service a

person who was born even in a family of dog-eaters may become

eligible to take part in the performance of the ritualistic ceremonies

4

The Nectar of Devotion

recommended in the Vedas. It is implicit in this statement that a per­
son born into a family of dog-eaters is generally not fit for performing

yajna, or sacrifice. The priestly caste in charge of performing these
ritualistic ceremonies recommended in the Vedas is called the briih­

mar-a order. Unless one is a briihmar-a, he cannot perform these
ceremomes.

A person is born in a briihmar-a family or in a family of dog-eaters
due to his past activities. If a person is born in a family of dog-eaters

it means that his past activities are all sinful. But if even such a person
takes to the path of devotional service and begins to chant the holy

names of the Lord-Ha re Kr§fLa, Hare Kr§fLa, Kr§r-a K[§[La, Hare Hare/
Hare Riima, Hare Riima, Riima Riima, Hare Hare-he is at once fit to

perform the ritualistic ceremonies. This means that his sip.ful reactions
have immediately become neutralized.
It is stated in the Padma Puriir-a that there are four kinds of effects

due to sinful activities, which are listed as follows:

l) the effect

which is not yet fructified, 2) the effect which is lying as seed, 3) the

effect which is already mature, and 4) the effect which is almost
mature. It is also stated that all these four effects become im­

mediately vanquished for those who surrender unto the Supreme
Personality of Godhead, Vi9�u, and become engaged in His devo­
tional service in full l(rg1a consciousness.
Those effects described as "almost mature" refer to the distress
from which one is suffering at present, and the effects "lying as seed"
means that in the core of the heart there is a certain stock of sinful
desires which are like seeds. The Sanskrit word kutam means that they
are almost ready to produce the seed, or the effect of the seed. An
"immature effect" refers to the case where the seedling has not be­
gun. From this statement of Padma Puriir-a it is understood that
material contamination is very subtle. Its beginning, its fruition and
results, and how one suffers such results in the form of distress, are
part of a great chain. When_ one catches some disease, it is often very
difficult to ascertain the cause of the disease, where it originated, and
how it is maturing. The suffering of a disease, however, does not
appear all of a sudden. It actually takes time. And, as in the medical
field, for precaution's sake, the doctor injects a vaccination to pre-

Characteristics of Pu.re Devotional Service

5

vent the growing of contamination, similarly, the practical injection

to stop all the fructifications of the seeds of our sinful activities is
simply engagement in Krwa consciousness.

In this connection, Sukadeva Gosvam1 speaks in the Sixth Canto

of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, 2nd Chapter, 17th verse, about the story of
Ajamila, who began life as a fine and dutiful briihmw;w but in his

young manhood became wholly corrupted by a prostitute. At the

end of his wicked life, just by calling the name of "Naraya�a
[Kr��a] ," he was saved despite so much sin. Sukadeva points out

that austerity, charity and the performance of ritualistic ceremonies

for counteracting sinful activities are recommended processes, but

that by performing them one cannot remove the sinful desire-seed

from the heart, as was the case with Ajiimila in his youth. This sinful

desire-seed can be removed only by achieving Kn;�a consciousness.

And this can be accomplished very easily by chanting the mahii­

mantra, or Hare Krffla mantra, as recommended by Sri Caitanya
Mahaprabhu. In other words, unless one adopts the path of devo­

tional service, he cannot be one hundred percent clean from all the

reactions of sinful activities.
By performing Vedic ritualistic activities, by giving money in
charity and by undergoing austerity, one can temporarily become

free from the reactions of sinful activities, but at the next moment

he must again become engaged in sinful activities. For example, a
person suffering from venereal disease on account of excessive
indulgence in sex life has to undergo some severe pain in medical

treatment, and he is then cured for the time being. But because he

has not been able to remove the sex desire from his heart, he must

again indulge in the same thing and become a victim of the same

disease. So medical treatment may give temporary relief from the

distress of such venereal disease, but unless one is trained to under­

stand that sex life is abominable, it is impossible to be saved from

such repeated distress. Similarly, the ritualistic performances, charity
and austerity which are recommended in the Vedas may temporarily

stop one from acting in sinful ways, but as long as the heart is not

clear, one will have to repeat sinful activities again and again.

Another example is gi ven in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam of the ele-

6

The Nectar of Devotion

phant who enters into a lake and takes a bath very seriously, cleansing
his body thoroughly. Then as soon as he comes onto shore he
again takes some dust from the earth and throws it over his body.
Similarly,

a person

who is not trained in Kr�!la consciousness

cannot become completely free from the desire for sinful activities.
Neither the _yoga process, nor philosophical speculations, nor fruitive
activities can save one from the seeds of sinful desires. Only by being
engaged in devotional service can this be done.
There

is

another

evidence in

the

Fourth

Canto of Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, 22nd Chapter, 37th verse, wherein Sanat-kumara says,
"My dear King, the false ego of a human being is so strong that it
keeps him in material existence as if tied up by a strong rope. Only
the devotees can cut off the knot of this strong rope very easily,
by engaging themselves in Kr�!J.a consciousness. Others, who are not
in Kr�!la consciousness but are trying to become great mystics or
great ritual-performers,cannot advance like the devotees. Therefore,
it is the duty of everyone to engage himself in the activities of
Kr�!la consciousness in order to be freed from the tight knot of
false ego and engagement in material activities."
This tight knot of false ego is due to ignorance. As long as one is
ignorant about his identification, he is sure to act wrongly and
thereby become entangled in material contamination. This ignorance
of factual knowledge can also be dissipated by Kr�r;ta consciousness,

as is confirmed in the Padma Puriirw as follows: "Pure devotional
service in Kr�!J.a consciousness is the highest enlightenment, and
when such enlightenment is there, it is just like a blazing forest fire,
killing all the inauspicious snakes of desire." The example is being
given in this connection that when there is a forest fire the extensive
blazing automatically kills all the snakes in the forest. There are
many, many snakes on the ground of the forest, and when a fire
takes place, it burns the dried foliage,and the snakes are immediately
attacked. Animals who have four legs can flee from the fire or can
at least try to flee, but the snakes are immediately killed. Simi­
larly, the blazing fire of Kr�!la consciousness is so strong that the
snakes of ignorance are immediately killed.

L

Characteristics of Pure Devotional Service

Kr��a Consciousness is All-Auspicious

Srila Riipa Gosvami has given a definition of auspiciousness. He

says that actual auspiciousness means welfare activities for all the

people of the world. At the present moment groups of people are

engaged in welfare activities in terms of society, community or
nation. There is even an attempt in the form of the United Nations

for world-help activity. But due to the shortcomings of limited

national activities, such a general mass welfare program for the whole

world is not practically possible. The Kr9!1a consciousness movement,
however, is so nice that it can render the highest benefit to the entire

human race. Everyone can be attracted by this movement, and every­

one can feel the result. Therefore, Riipa Gosvami and other learned
scholars agree that a broad propaganda program for the Kr9!1a con­

sciousness movement of devotional service all over the world is the

highest humanitarian welfare activity.

How the Kr9!1a consciousness movement can attract the attention

of the whole world and how each and every man can feel pleasure in
this Kr9!1a consciousness is stated in the Padma Puriirw as follows: "A

person who is engaged in devotional service in full Krwa conscious­

ness is to be understood to be doing the best service to the whole

world and to be pleasing everyone in the world. In addition to

human society, he is pleasing even the trees and animals because they

also become attracted by such a movement." A practical example of

this was shown by Lord Caitanya when He was traveling through the
forests of Jharikhanda in central India for spreading His sankirtana

movement. The tigers, the elephants, the deer and all other wild ani­

mals joined Him and were participating, in their own ways, by

dancing and chanting Hare Krwa.

Furthermore, a person engaged in Kr9�a consciousness, acting

in devotional service, can develop all the good qualities that are
generally found in the demigods. It is said by Sukadeva Gosvami in

the Fifth Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, 18th Chapter, 12th verse,

"My dear King, persons who have unflinching faith in Kr9!1a and

are without any duplicity can develop all the good qualities of the

demigods. On account of a devotee's high grade of Kr9�a conscious-

The Nectar o.fDevotion

8

ness even the demigods like to live with him, and therefore it can be
understood that the qualities of the demigods have developed within
his body."
On the other hand, a person who is not in Kg;!J.a consciousness has
no good qualities. He may be highly educated from the academic
point of view, but in the actual field of his activities he can be seen
to be baser than the animals. Even though a person is highly educated
academically, if he cannot go beyond the sphere of mental activities
then he is sure to perform only material activities and thus remain
impure. There are so many persons in the modern world who have
been highly educated in the materialistic universities, but it is seen
that they cannot take up the movement of Kr�!la consciousness
and develop the high qualities of the demigods.
For example, a Kr�!la conscious boy, even if he is not very well
educated by the university standard, can immediately give up all
illicit sex life, gambling, meat-eating and intoxication; whereas those
who are not in Kr�!la consciousness, although very highly educated,
are often drunkards, meat-eaters, sex-mongers and gamblers. These
are practical proofs of how a Kr�!la conscious person becomes highly
developed in good qualities, whereas a person who is not in Kr�pa
consciousness cannot do so. We experience that even a young boy in
Kr��1a consciousness is unattached to cinemas, night clubs, naked
dance shows, restaurants, liquor shops, etc. He becomes completely
freed. He saves his valuable time from being extravagantly spent in
the way of smoking, drinking, attending the theater and dancing.
One who is not in Kr�!la consciousness usually cannot sit silently
even for half an hour. The yoga system teaches that if you become
silent you will realize that you are God. This system may be all right
for materialistic persons, but how long will they be able to keep
themselves silent?

Artificially, they may sit down for so-called

meditation, but immediately after their yogic performance, they will
engage themselves again in such activities as illicit sex life, gambling,
meat-eating and many other nonsensical things. But a Kr�!la conscious
person gradually elevates himself without endeavoring for this so­
called silent meditation. Simply because he is engaged in Kr�!la
consciousness he automatically gives up all this nonsense and develops

Characteristics of Pure Devotional Service

9

a high character. One develops the highest character by becoming a

pure devotee of Kr�!la. The conclusion is that no one can truly have
any good qualities if he is lacking Kr�!la consciousness.

Happiness in Kr�!la Consciousness
Srila Riipa Gosvami has analyzed the different sources of happi­

ness. He has divided happiness into three categories, which are:

1)

happiness derived from material enjoyment, 2) happiness derived by
identifying oneself with the Supreme Brahman, and

derived from Krsna consciousness.

3) happiness

In the Tantra s dStra Lord Siva speaks to his wife, Sati, in this way:
-·

.

"My dear wife, a person who has surrendered himself at the lotus

feet of Govinda and who has thus developed pure Kr�!la conscious­

ness can be very easily awarded all the perfections desired by the
impersonalists; and beyond this, he can enjoy the happiness achieved

by the pure devotees."

Happiness derived from pure devotional service is the highest

because it is eternal. But the happiness derived from material
perfection

or understanding oneself to be Brahman is inferior

because it is temporary. There is no preventing one's falling down

from material happiness,· and there is even every chance of falling

down from the spiritual happiness derived out of identifying oneself

with the impersonal Brahman.
It has been seen that great miiyiiviidi (impersonalist)
-very

times

highly

take

to

educated

and

almost

realized

sannyiisis

souls-may

some­

political activities or to social welfare activities.

The reason is that they actually do not derive any ultimate tran­

scendental happiness in the impersonal understanding and there­

fore must come down to the material platform and take to such

mundane affairs. There are many instances, especially in India,
where these

miiyiiviidi sannyiisis descend to the material platform

again. But a person who is fully in Krwa consciousness will never

return to

any sort of material platform.

However alluring and

attracting they may be, he always knows that no material welfare

10

The Nectar of Devotion

activities

can be compared with the spiritual activity of Kr��a

consciOusness.
The mystic perfections achieved by actually successful yogis
are eight in number. A-t;limii-siddhi refers to the power by which one
can become so small that he can enter into a stone. Modern scientific
improvements also enable us to enter into stone because they provide
for excavating so many subways, penetrating the hills, etc. So,
al}imii-siddhi, the mystic perfection of trying to enter into stone,
has also b�en achieved by material science. Similarly, all of the
yoga-siddhis, or perfections, are material arts. For example, in one
yoga-siddhi there is development of the power to become so light
that one can float in the air or on water. That is also being performed
by modern scientists. They are flying in the air, they are floating on
the surface of the water, and they are traveling under the water.
After comparing all these mystic yoga-siddhis to materialistic
perfections it is found that the materialistic scientists try for the
same perfections. So actually there is no difference between mystic
perfection and materialistic perfection. A German scholar once said
that the so-called yoga perfections have already been achieved by
the modern scientists, and so he was not concerned with them.
He intelligently went to India to learn how he could understand his
eternal relationship with the Supreme Lord by means of bhakti­
yoga, devotional service.
Of course, in the categories of mystic perfection there are certain
processes which, the material scientists have not yet been able to
develop. For instance, a mystic yogi can enter into the sun planet
simply by using the rays of the sunshine. This perfection is called
laghimii.

Similarly, a yogi can touch the moon with his finger.

Though the modern astronauts go to the moon with the help of
spaceships,

they undergo many difficulties, whereas a person with

mystic perfection can extend his hand and touch the moon with his
finger. This siddhi is called priipti, or acquisition. With this priipti­
siddhi, the perfect mystic yogi can not only touch the moon planet,
but he can extend his hand anywhere and take whatever he likes. He
may be sitting thousands of miles away from a certain place, and if

he likes he can take fruit from a garden there. This is priipti-siddhi.
The modern scientists have manufactured nuclear weapons with
which they can destroy an insignificant part of this planet, but by
the yoga-siddhi known as isitii one can create and destroy an entire
planet simply at will. Another perfection is called vasitii, and by
this perfection one can bring anyone under his control. This is a kind
of hypnotism which is almost irresistible. Sometimes it .is found that

a yogi who may have attained a little perfection in this vasitii mystic

power comes out among the people and speaks all sorts of nonsense,

controls their minds, exploits them, takes their money and then goes

away.

There is another mystic perfection which is known as priikiimya

(magic). By this priikiimya power one can achieve anything he likes.

For example, one can make water enter into his eye and then again
come out from within the eye. Simply by his will he can perform
such wonderful activities.
The highest perfection of mystic power is called kiimiivasiiyitii.
This is also magic, but whereas the priikiimya power acts to create

wonderful effects within the scope of nature, kiimiivasiiyitii permits
one to contradict nature-in other words, to do the impossible. Of

course, one can derive great amounts of temporary happiness by
achieving such yogic materialistic perfections.

Foolishly, people who are enamored of the glimmer of modern

materialistic advancement are thinking that the Kr�l).a consciousness

movement is for less intelligent men. "I am better off being busy with
my material comforts-maintaining a nice apartment, family and sex

life." These people do not know that at any moment they can be

kicked out of their material situation. Due to ignorance, they do not

know that real life is eternal. The temporary comforts of the body

are not the goal of life, and it is due only to darkest ignorance that
people become enamored of the glimmering advancement of material

comforts.

Snl.a Bhaktivinode Thakur has therefore said that the advancement

of material knowledge renders a person more foolish because it causes

one to forget his real identification by its glimmer. This is doom for

12

him, because this human form of life is meant for getting out of the

material contamination. By the advancement of material knowledge,

people are becoming more and more entangled in material existence.
They have no hope of being liberated from this catastrophe.

In the Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya it is stated that Prahlada Maharaj, a

great devotee of the Lord, prayed to Nrsimhadeva (the half-lion half­

man incarnation), as follows: "My dear Lord, I repeatedly pray unto
Your lotus feet that I may simply be stronger in devotional service. I

simply pray that my Krwa consciousness may be more strong and
steady, because happiness derived out of Kr��a consciousness and

devotional service is so powerful that with it one can have all the

other perfections of religiousness, economic development, sense

gratification and even the attainment of liberation from material

existence."
Actually, a pure devotee does not aspire after any of these per­

fections because the happiness derived from devotional service in

Kr�pa consciousness is so transcendental and so unlimited that no

other happiness can be compared with it. It is said that even one drop

of happiness in Kr��a consciousness stands beyond comparison with
an ocean of happiness derived from any other activity. Thus, any

person who has developed even a little quantity of pure devotional
service can very easily kick out all the other kinds of happiness de­
rived from religiousness, economic development, sense gratification

and liberation.

There was a great devotee of Lord Caitanya known as Kholaveca

Sridhara, who was a very poor man. He was doing a small business

selling cups made from the leaves of plantain trees, and his income

was almost nothing. Still, he was spending fifty percent of his small

income on the worship of the Ganges, and with the other fifty per­

cent he was somehow living. Lord Caitanya once revealed Himself to

this confidential devotee, Kholaveca Srldhara, and offered him any

opulence that he liked. But Srldhara informed the Lord that he did
not want any material opulence. He was quite happy in his present

position and wanted only to gain unflinching faith and devotion unto
the lotus feet of Lord Caitanya. That is the position of the pure de-

Characteristics of Pure Devotional Service

13

votees. If they can be engaged twenty-four hours each day in devo­
tional service they do not want anything else, not even the happiness
of liberation or of becoming one with the supreme.
In the Niirada-paiicariitra it is also said that any person who has
developed even a small amount of devotional service doesn't care
a fig for any kind of happiness derived from religiousness, economic
development, sense gratification, or the five kinds of liberation.
Any kind of happiness derived from religiousness, economic develop­
ment, liberation or sense gratification cannot even dare to enter
into the heart of a pure devotee. It is stated that as the personal
attendants and

maidservants

of a queen follow the queen with

all respect and obeisances, similarly the joys of religiousness, economic
development, sense gratification and liberation follow the devotional
service of the Lord. In other words, a pure devotee does not lack any
kind of happiness derived from any source. He does not want any­
thing but service to Kr��a, but even if he should have another desire,
the Lord fulfills this without the devotee's asking.

Rareness of Pure Devotional Service

In the preliminary phase of spiritual life there are different kinds
of austerities, penances and similar processes for attaining self­
realization. However, even if an executor of these processes is with­
out any material desire, he still cannot achieve devotional service.
And aspiring by oneself alone to achieve devotional service is also
not very hopeful because Kr��a does not agree to award devotional
service to merely anyone. Krwa can easily offer a person material
happiness or even liberation, but He does not agree very easily to
award a person engagement in His devotional service. Devotional
service can in fact be attained only through the mercy of a pure
devotee. In the Caitanya-caritiimrta it is said: "By the mercy of the
spiritual master who is a pure devotee and by the mercy of Kr��a one
can achieve the platform of devotional service. There is no other
way.

"

The rarity of devotional service is also confirmed in the Tantra-

The Nectar of Devotion

14

siistra where Lord Siva says to Sati, "My dear Sati, if one is a very

fine philosopher, analyzing the different processes of knowledge, he
can achieve liberation from the material entanglement. By perfor­

mance of the ritualistic sacrifices recommended in the Vedas one can

be elevated to the platform of pious activities and thereby enjoy the
material comforts of life to the fullest extent. But all such endeavors

can hardly offer anyone devotional service to the Lord, not even if

one tries for it by such processes for many, many thousands of

births."

In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam it is also confirmed by Prahlada Maharaj

that merely by personal efforts or by the instructions of higher
authorities one cannot attain to the stage of devotional service. One

must become blessed by the dust of the lotus feet of a pure devotee
who is completely freed from the contamination of material desires.

In the Fifth Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, 6th Chapter, 18th verse,

Narada also says to Yudhi�thira, "My dear King, it is Lord Kr�!la,

known as Mukunda, who is the eternal protector of the Pa!\9-avas

and the Yadus. He is also your spiritual master and instructor in

every respect. He is the only worshipable God for you. He is very

dear and affectionate, and He is the director of all your activities,

both individual and familial. And what's more, He sometimes carries

out your orders as if He were your messenger! My dear King, how
very fortunate you are, because for others all these favors given to

you by the Supreme Lord would not even be dreamt of." The pur­

port to this verse is that the Lord easily offers liberation, but He

rarely agrees to offer a soul devotional service because by devotional

service the Lord Himself becomes purchased by the devotee.

The Happiness of Becoming One with the Supreme

Srila Rupa Gosvami says that if brahmiinanda, or the happiness of

becoming one with the Supreme, is multiplied by one trillionfold,

still it cannot be compared with an atomic fraction of the happiness
derived from the ocean of devotional service.

In the Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya Prahlada Maharaj, while satisfying

Characteristics of Pure Devotional Service

15

Lord Nrsimhadeva by his prayers, says: "My dear Lord of the uni­

verse, I am feeling transcendental pleasure in Your presence and have

become merged in the ocean of happiness. I now consider the happi­

ness of brahmananda to be no more than the water in the impression

left by a cow's hoof in the earth, compared to this ocean of bliss."
Similarly, it is confirmed in the Bhavartha-dipika, Sridhara Svami's
commentary on the Srim ad-Bhagavatam : "My dear Lord, some of

the fortunate persons who are swimming in the ocean of Your nectar

of devotion, and who are relishing the nectar of the narration of Your
pastimes, certainly know ecstasies which immediately minimize the

value of the happiness derived from religiousness, economic develop­

ment, sense gratification and liberation. Such a transcendental devo­

tee regards any kind of happiness other than devotional service as no

better than straw in the street."

Attracting K���a
Srila Riipa Gosvami has stated that devotional service attracts even

Kr��a. Kr��a attracts everyone, but devotional service attracts Kr��a.

The symbol of devotional service in the highest degree is Radhara�i.

Kr��a is called Madana-mohana, which means that He is so attractive

that He can defeat the attraction of thousands of Cupids. But

Radharani
is still more attractive, for She can even attract Krsna.
. ..
.

Therefore devotees call Her Madana-mohana-mohani-the attractor of

the attractor of Cupid.

To perform devotional service means to follow in the footsteps of

Radhara�i, and devotees in Vrndavana put themselves under the
care of Radhara�i in order to achieve perfection in their devotional

service. In other words, devotional service is not an activity of the
material world; it is directly under the control of Radhara�i. In

Bhagavad-gita it is confirmed that the mahatmas, or great souls, are
under the protection of daivi prakrti, the internal energy-Radhara�i.
So, being directly under the control of the internal potency of Kr��a,

devotional service attracts even Kr�!la Himself.

This fact is corroborated by Kr��a in the Eleventh Canto of

16

The Nectar of Devotion

Srimad-Bhiigavatam,

12th Chapter, lst verse, where He says: "My

dear Uddhava, you may know it from Me that the attraction I feel
for devotional service rendered by My devotees is not to be attained
even by the performance of mystic yoga, philosophical speculation,

ritualistic sacrifices, the study of Vedanta, the practice of severe

austerities or the giving of everything in charity. These are, of course,
very nice activities, but they are not as attractive to Me as the tran­
scendental loving service rendered by My devotees."
How Kn;�a becomes attracted by the devotional service of His

devotees is described by Narada in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, Seventh
Canto,

lOth

Chapter, 37th verse. There Narada addresses King

Yudhi�thira while the King is appreciating the glories of the character
of Prahlada Maharaj. A devotee always appreciates the activities of
other devotees. Yudhi�thira Maharaj was appreciating the qualities
of Prahlada, and that is one symptom of a pure devotee. A pure
devotee never thinks himself as great; he always thinks that other
devotees are greater than himself. The King was thinking, "Prahlada
Maharaj is actually a devotee of the Lord, while I am nothing,"
and while thinking this he was addressed by Narada as follows:
"My dear King Yudhi�thira, in this world you [the Pa�9ava brothers]
are the only fortunate people. The Supreme Personality of Godhead
has appeared on this planet and is presenting Himself to you as an
ordinary human being. He is always with you in all circumstances.
He is living with you and covering Himself from the eyes of others.
Others cannot understand that He is the Supreme Lord, but He is still
living with you as your cousin, as your friend and even as your mes­
senger. Therefore you must know that nobody in this world is more
fortunate than you."

In the Bhagava d-gitii when Krwa appeared in His universal form,
,

Arjuna prayed: "My dear Kr��a, I thought of You as my cousin­
brother, and so I have shown disrespect to You in so many ways,
calling You Kr��a, or friend. But You are so great that I could not
understand." So that was the position of the Pap9avas; although
Krwa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, the greatest among all
greats, still He remained with those royal brothers, being attracted
by their devotion, by their friendship and by their love. That is the

Characteristics of Pure Devotional Service

17

proof of how great this process of devotional service is. It can attract
even the Supreme Personality of Godhead. God is great, but devo­
tional service is greater than God because it attracts Him. People who
are not in devotional service can never understand what great value
there is in rendering service to the Lord.

2 I The First Stages of Devotion

The three categories of devotional service which Srila Riipa Go­

svami describes in Bhakti-rasiimrta-sindhu are listed as devotional

service in practice, devotional service in ecstasy and devotional service

in pure love of Godhead. There are many sub-headings in each of

these categories. Generally it is understood that in the category of
devotional service in practice there are two different qualities; de­

votional service in ecstasy has four qualities, and devotional service in
pure love of Godhead has six qualities. These qualities will be ex­

plained by Srila Riipa Gosvami later on.

In this connection, Srila Riipa Gosvami suggests that the person

eligible for .Kr��a consciousness or devotional service can be classified
by his particular taste. He says that devotional service is a continual
process from one's previous life. No one can take to devotional ser­
vice unless he has had some previous connection with it. For example,

suppose in this life I practice devotional service to some extent. Even

though it is not one hundred percent perfectly performed, still what­

ever I have done will not be lost. In my next life, from the very point

where I stopped in this life, I shall begin again. In this way there is
always a continuity. But even if there is no continuity, if only by

chance a person takes interest in a pure devotee's instruction, he can

be accepted and advance in devotional service. Anyway, for persons
who have a natural taste for understanding books like the Bhagavad­

gitii and Srimad-Bhiigavatam, devotional service is easier than for those
who are simply accustomed to mental speculation and argumentative

processes.

To support this statement there are many authoritative assertions
18

The First Stages of Devotion

19

by the learned scholars of bygone ages. According to their general
opinion, a person may become governed by certain convictions de­
rived by his own arguments and decisions. Then another person, who
may be a greater logician, will nullify these conclusions and establish

another thesis. In this way the path of argument will never be safe

or conclusive. The Srimad-Bhiigavatam recommends, therefore, that

one follow in the footsteps of the authorities.

Here is a general description of devotional service given by Sri

Riipa Gosvami in his Bhakti-rasiimrta-sindhu. Previously, it has been

stated that devotional service can be divided into three categories­

namely, devotional service in practice, devotional service in ecstasy,
and devotional service in pure love of God. Now Sri Riipa Gosvami
proposes to describe devotional service in practice.
Practice means employing our senses in some particular type of
work. Therefore devotional service in practice means utilizing our
different sensory organs in service to Kr�rta. Some of the senses are
meant for acquiring knowledge, and some are meant for executing
the conclusions of our thinking, feeling and willing. So practice
means employing both the mind and the senses in practical devo­
tional service. This practice is not for developing something artificial.
For example, a child learns or practices to walk. This walking is not
unnatural. The walking capacity is there originally in the child, and
simply by a little practice he walks very nicely. Similarly, devotional

service to the Supreme Lord is the natural instinct of every living

entity. Even uncivilized men like the aborigines offer their respectful
obeisances to something wonderful exhibited by nature's law, and

they appreciate that behind some wonderful exhibition or action

there is something supreme. So this consciousness, though lying
dormant in those who are materially contaminated, is found in
every living entity. And, when purified, this is called Kr�rta con­

sciOusness.
There are certain prescribed methods for employing our senses and

mind in such a way that our dormant consciousness for loving Kr�rta
will be invoked, as much as the child, with a little practice, can begin
to walk. One who has no basic walking capacity cannot walk by

practice. Similarly, Kr�rta consciousness cannot be aroused simply by

The Nectar of Devotion

20

practice. Actually there is no such practice. When we wish to develop
our innate capacity for devotional service there are certain processes
which, by our accepting and executing them, will cause that dormant

capacity to be invoked. Such practice is called sadhana-bhakti.

Every living entity under the spell of material energy is held to be

in an abnormal condition of madness. In the Srimad-Bhagavatam it

is said: "Generally, the conditioned soul is mad because he is always
engaged in activities which are the causes of bondage and suffering."
Spirit soul in its original condition is joyful, blissful, eternal and full
of knowledge. Only by his implication in material activities has
he become miserable, temporary and full of ignorance. This is due
to vikarma. Vikarma means actions which should not be done. There­
fore,

we

must

practice

sadhana-bhakti-which

means

to offer

mangala-aratrika (Deity worship) in the morning, to refrain from
certain material activities, to offer obeisances to the spiritual master
and to follow many other rules and regulations which will be dis­
cussed here one after another. These practices will help one to be­
come cured of madness. As a man's mental disease is cured by the
directions of a psychiatrist, so this sadhana-bhakti cures the condi­

tioned soul of his madness under the spell of maya, material illusion.
Narada

Muni

mentions

this

sadhana-bhakti

in the Srimad­

Bhagavatam, Seventh Canto, lst Chapter, 30th verse. He says there
to King Yudhi�thira: "My dear King, one has to fix his mind-on Kr��a
by any means." That is called Kr��a consciousness. It is the duty of

the acarya, the spiritual master, to find the ways and means for his

disciple to fix his mind on Krwa. That is the beginning of sadhana­
b!Jakti.

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu has given us an authorized program for

this purpose, centered around the chanting of the Hare Kr§!W
mantra.

This chanting has so much power that it immediately

attaches one to Kr��a. That is the beginning of sadhana-bhakti.

Somehow or other, one has to fix his mind on Kr��a. The great
saint Ambar'i�a Maharaj, although a responsible king, fixed his mind
on Kr��a, and similarly anyone who tries to fix his mind in this way
will very rapidly make progress in successfully reviving his original
Kr��a consciousness.

The First Stages of Devotion

21

Now this siidhana-bhakti, or practice of devotional service, can also

be divided into two parts. The first part is called regulative principles:

one has to follow these different regulative principles by the order
of the spiritual master, or on the strength of authoritative scriptures,

and there can be no question of refusal. That is called vaidhi, or

regulated. One has to do it without any argument. Another part of

siidhana-bhakti is called riigiinugii. Riigiinugii refers to the point at

which, by following the regulative principles, one becomes a little
more attached to Kr��a

and executes devotional service out of

natural love. For example, a person engaged in devotional service may

be ordered to rise early in the morning and offer iiriitrika, which is

a form of Deity worship. In the beginning, by the order of his

spiritual master, one rises early in the morning and offers iiriitrika,

but then he develops real attachment. When he gets this attachment,

he automatically tries to decorate the Deity and prepare different
kinds of dresses and thinks of different plans to execute his devo­

tional service nicely. Although it is within the category of practice,
this offering of loving service is spontaneous. So the practice of devo­

tional service, siidhana-bhakti, can be divided into two parts-namely,

regulative and spontaneous.
Riipa Gosvami defines the first part of devotional practice, or

vaidhi-bhakti, as follows: "When there is no attachment or no

spontaneous loving service to the Lord, and one is engaged in the
service of the Lord simply out of obedience to the order of the

spiritual master or in pursuance of the scriptures, such obligatory
service is called vaidhi-bhakti."

These principles of vaidhi-bhakti are also described in the Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, Second Canto, lst Chapter, verse 35, where Sukadeva

Gosvami instructs the dying Maharaj Parik�it as to his course of

action. Maharaj Parik�it met Sukadeva Gosvami just a week before

his death, and the King was perplexed as to what should be done

before he was to pass on. Many other sages also arrived there, but
no one could give him the proper direction. Sukadeva Gosvami,

however, gave this direction to him as follows: "My dear King, if you

want to be fearless in meeting your death next week (for actually

everyone is afraid at the point of death), then you must immediately

The Nectar of Devotion

22

begin the process of hearing and chanting and remembering God."

If one can chant and hear Hare K:r��a and always remember Lord

K:r��a, then he is sure to become fearless of death, which may come

at any moment.

In the statements of Sukadeva Gosvami it is said that the Supreme

Personality of Godhead is K:r��a. Therefore Sukadeva recommends
that one should always hear about K:r��a. He does not recommend

that one hear and chant about the demigods. The

miiyiiviidis

(impersonalists) say that you can chant any name, either that of
K:r��a or those of the demigods, and the result will be the same.

But actually this is not a fact. According to the authorized version

of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, one has to hear and chant abou't Lord
Vi��u (K:r��a) only.

So Sukadeva Gosvami has recommended to Parik�it Maharaj that

in order to be fearless of death one has to hear and chant and remem­

ber the Supreme Personality of Godhead, K:r��a, by all means. He
also mentions that the Supreme Personality of Godhead is sarviitmii.

Sarviitmii means "the supersoul of everyone." K:r��a is also men- .
tioned as isvara, the supreme controller who is situated in everyone's

heart. Therefore, if some way or other we become attached to K:r��a,

He will make us free from all danger. In the Bhagavad-gitii it is said

that anyone who becomes a devotee of the Lord is never vanquished.
Others, however, are always vanquished. Vanquished means

that

after getting this human form of life, a person does not come out of

the entanglement of birth and death and thus misses his golden op­

portunity. Such a person does not know where he is being thrown by
'
the laws of nature.

Suppose one does not develop K:r��a consciousness in this human

form of life. He will be thrown into the cycle of birth and death in­
volving 8,400,000 species of life, and his spiritual identity will re­

main lost. One does not know whether he is going to be a plant, or a
beast, or a bird, or something like that, because there are so many
species of life. The recommendation of Riipa Gosvami for reviving

our original Kr��a consciousness is that somehow or other we should

apply our minds to Kr��a very seriously. and thus also become fear­

less of death. After death we do not know our destination, because

The First Stages of Devotion

23

we are completely under the control of the laws of nature. Only
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, is controller over the
laws of nature. Therefore, if we take shelter of Kr��a seriously, there
will be no fear of being thrown back into the cycle of so many spe­
cies of life. A sincere devotee will surely be transferred to the abode
of Kr��a, as affirmed in the Bhagavad-gitii.
In the Padma Puriir;w also the same process is advised. There it is
said that one should always remember Lord V i� �u. This is called
dhyiina, or meditation-always remembering Kr��a. It is said that one

has to meditate with his mind fixed upon Vi��u. Padma Puriir;w
recommends that one always fix his mind on the form of Vi��u by
meditation and not forget Him at any tnoment. And this state of
consciousness is called samiidhi, or trance.
We should always try to mold the activities of our lives in such a
way that we will constantly remember Vi��u, or Kr��a. That is Kr��a
consciousness. Whether one concentrates his mind on the four-.
handed form of Vi��u or on the form of two-handed Kr��a, it is the
same. The Pad m a Puriirza recommends: somehow or other, always
think of Vi�l)U without forgetting Him under any circumstances.
Actually, this is the most basic of all regulative principles. For, when
there is an order from a superior about doing something, there is
simultaneously a prohibition. When the order is that one should al­
ways remember Krwa, the prohibition is that one should never forget
Him. Within this simple order and prohibition all regulative principles
are found complete.

This regulative principle is applicable to all varrzas and iisramas, the
castes and occupations of life. There are four varrzas, namely, the
briihmarzas (priests and intellectuals), the k§atriyas (warriors and

statesmen), the vaisyas (businessmen and farmers) and the siidras
(laborers and servants). There are also four standard iisramas, namely
brahmacarya (student life), grhastha (householder), viinaprastha (re­

tired) and sannyiisa (renounced). The regulative principles are not
only for the brahmaciiris (celibate students) to follow, but are appli­
cable for all. It doesn't matter whether one is a beginner-a brahma­
ciiri-or if one is very advanced-a sannyiisi. The principle of remem­
bering the Supreme Personality of Godhead constantly and not for-

The Nectar of Devotion

24

getting Him at any moment is meant to be followed by everyone
without fail.
If this injunction is followed, then all other rules and regulations
will automatically fall into line. All other rules and regulations
should be treated as assistants or servants to this one basic principle.
The injunctions of rules and regulations and the resultant reactions

are mentioned in the Eleventh Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, 5th
Chapter, 1st and 2nd verses. Camasa Muni, one of the nine sages who
came to instruct King Nimi, addressed the King and said, "The four

social orders, namely the briihma!las, the k§atriyas, the vaisyas, and
the siidras, have come out of the different parts of the universal form

of the Supreme Lord as follows: the briihmaflaS have come out from

the head, the k§atriyas have come out from the arms, the vaisyas have
come out from the waist, and the siidras have come out from the legs.

Similarly, the sannyiisis have come out from the head, the viinapras­

thas from the arms, the grhasthas from the waist, and the b ra h ma­

ciiris from the legs."

These different orders of society and grades of spiritual advance­
ment are conceived in terms of qualification. It is confirmed in the

Bhagavad-gitii that the four social orders and the four spiritual orders

are created by the Lord Himself, in terms of different individual
qualities. As the different parts of the body have different types of
activities, so the social orders and spiritual orders also have different
types of activities in terms of qualification and position. The target
of these activities, however, is always the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. As confirmed in the Bhagavad-gitii, "He is the supreme en­

joyer." So whether one is a briihma!la or a siidra, he has to satisfy the
Supreme Lord by his activities. This is also confirmed in the Srimad­

Bhiigavatam by a verse which reads: "Everyone must be engaged in
his particular duty, but the perfection of such work should be tested
by how far the Lord is satisfied with such activities." The injunction
herein is that one has to act according to his position, and by such
activities one must either satisfy the Supreme Persorality or else fall
down from his position.

For example, a briihma!la who is born out of the head of the Lord

has as his business to preach the transcendental Vedic sounds, or sabda-

\
The First Stages of Devotion

25

brahman. Because the briihmar.a is the head, he has to preach the

transcendental sound, and he also has to eat on behalf of the Supreme
Lord. According to Vedic injunctions, when a briihmar.a eats it is to
be understood that the Personality of Godhead is eating through him.
It is not, however, that the briihmal)a should simply eat on behalf of
the Lord and not preach the message of the Bhagavad-gitii to the
world. Actually, one .who preaches the message of the Gitii is very
dear to Kr��a, as is confirmed in the Gitii itself. Such a preacher is
factually a briihmar.a and thus by feeding him

one feeds the Su­

preme Lord directly.
Similarly, the k§atriya has to protect people from the onslaughts
of miiyii. That is his duty. For example, as soon as Maharaj Parik�it
saw that a black man was attempting to kill a cow, he immediately
took his sword, wanting to kill the black man, whose name was Kali . *

That is a k§atriya's duty. Violence is required in order to give pro­
tection. In the Bhagavad-gitii, Lord Kr��a directly gave His order to
Arjuna to commit violence on the battlefield of Kuruk�etra, just to
give protection to the people in general.
The vaisyas are meant for producing agricultural products, trading
them and distributing them. And the working class, or sudras, are
those who haven't the intelligence of the briihmal)as or the k§atriyas
or the vaiSyas, and therefore they are meant to help these higher
classes by bodily labor. In this way, there is full cooperation and
spiritu:tl advancement amongst all the different orders of society.
And when there is no such cooperation, the members of society will
fall down. That is the present position in the kali-yuga, this age of
quarrel. Nobody is doing his duty, and everyone is simply puffed-up
by calling himself a briihmal)a (intellectual) or a k§atriya (soldier or

statesman). But actually, such people are without status. They are
out of touch with the Supreme Personality of Godhead because they
consciousness moveconscious. Therefore the Krsna
are not Krsna

Krsna consciousness.
.
Lord Sri Kr��a instructed Uddhava that by following the injunc­

tions of the social and spiritual orders of human society one can

satisfy the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and as a result of such

satisfaction the whole society gets all the necessities of life amply and

without difficulty. This is because, after all, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead maintains all other living entities. If the whole society

performs its respective duties and remains in Kr��a consciousness"'"
hl.
there is no doubt that all of its members will live very peacefully and
happily. Without wanting the necessities of life, the wh�le world will
be turned into

Vaiku!'-tha, a spiritual abode. Even without being

transferred to the kingdom of God, by following the injunctions of
the Srimad-Bhiigavatam and prosecuting the duties of Kr��a con­
sciousness, all human society will be happy in all respects.

There is a similar statement by Sri Kr��a Himself to Uddhava in

the Eleventh Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, 5th Chapter, 2nd verse.
The Lord says there, "My dear Uddhava, all persons are engaged in
activities, whether those indicated in the revealed scriptures or ordi­

nary worldly activities. If by the result of either of such activities

they worship Me in Kr��a consciousness, then automatically they be­

come very happy within this world as well as in the next. Of this

there is no doubt." We can conclude from this statement by Kn;�a
that activities in Kr��a consciousness will give everyone all perfection

in their desires.

Thus the Kr��a consciousness movement is so nice that there is no
need of even designating oneself briihma!'-a, k§atriya, vaisya, siidra,

brahmaciiri, grhastha, viinaprastha or sannyiisi. Let everyone be en­
gaged in whatever occupation he now has. Simply let him worship

Lord Kr��a by the result of his activities in Krwa consciousness. That
will adjust the whole situation,and everyone will be happy and peace­
ful within this world. In the Niirada-paiicariitra the regulative princi­

ples of devotional service are described as follows: "Any activities
sanctioned in the revealed scriptures and aiming at the satisfaction of
the Supreme Personality of Godhead are accepted by saintly teachers
as the regulative principles of devotional service. If somebody regu-

...

larly executes such service unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead
under the direction of a bona fide spiritual master, then gradually he
rises to the platform of serving in pure love of God."

3 I Eligibility of the Candidate
for Accepting Devotional Service

On account of his association with mahatmas, or great souls one

hundred percent in the devotional service of the Lord, one may at­

tain a little bit of attraction for Sri' Kr��a. But at the same time one

may remain very much attached to fruitive activities and material

sense enjoyment and not be prepared to undergo the different types
of renunciation. Such a person, if he has unflinching attraction to

Kr��a,

serVIce.

becomes an eligible candidate for discharging devotional

This attraction for K{��a consciousness in association with pure

devotees is the sign of great fortune. It is confirmed by Lord Caitanya

that only the fortunate persons, by the mercy of both a bona fide
spiritual master and Kr��a, will get the seed of devotional service. In
this connection, Lord Kr��a says in Srimad-Bhagavatam, Eleventh
Canto, 20th Chapter, verse 8: "My dear Uddhava, only by excep­

tional fortune does someone

become attracted to Me (Kr��a).

And even if one is not completely detached from fruitive activities,

or is not completely attached to devotional service, such service is
quickly effective."

Devotees can be divided into three classes. The first or uppermost

class is described as follows: one is very expert in the study of rele­

vant scriptures, and he is also expert in putting forward arguments in

terms of those scriptures. He can very nicely present conclusions
with perfect discretion and can consider the ways of devotional ser­

vice in a decisive way. He understands perfectly that the ultimate

goal of life is to attain to the transcendental loving service of Kr��a,

and he knows that Kr��a is the only object of worship and love. This
28

Eligibility of the Candidate for Accepting Devotional Service

29

first-class devotee is one who has strictly followed the rules and regu­
lations under the training of a bona fide spiritual master and has sin­
cerely obeyed him in accord with revealed scriptures. Thus being
fully trained to preach and become a spiritual master himself, he is
considered first-class. A first-class devotee never ·deviates from the
principles of higher authority, and he attains firm faith in the scriptures
by understanding with all reasons and arguments. When we speak of
arguments and reason, it means arguments and reason on the basis of
revealed scripture. The first-class devotee is not interested in dry
speculative methods meant for wasting time. In other words, one
who has attained a mature determination in the matter of devotional
service can be accepted as the first-class devotee.
The second-class de�otee has been defined by the following symp­
toms: he is not very expert in arguing on the strength of revealed
scripture, but he has firm faith in the objective. The purport of this
description is that the second-class devotee has firm faith in the pro­
cedure of devotional service unto Kr��a, but he may sometimes fail
to offer arguments and decisions on the strength of revealed scrip­
ture to an opposing party. But at the same time he is still undaunted
within himself as to his decision that Kr��a is the supreme object of
worship.
The neophyte or third-class devotee is one whose faith is not
strong and, at the same time, does not recognize the decision of the
revealed scripture. The neophyte's faith can be changed by someone
else with strong arguments or by an opposite decision. Unlike the
second-class devotee, who also cannot put forward arguments and
evidences from the scripture, but who still has all faith in the objec­
tive, the neophyte has no firm faith in the objective. Thus he is called
the neophyte devotee.
Further classification of the neophyte devotee is made in the

Bhagavad-gitii. It is stated there that four classes of men-namely
those who are distressed, those who are in need of money, those who
are inquisitive and those who are wise-begin devotional service and
come to the Lord for relief in the matter of their respective self­
satisfaction. They go into some place of worship and pray to God for
mitigation <;>f material distress, or for some economic development,

�,.,.

The Nectar of Devotion

30

or to satisfy their inquisitiveness. And a wise man who simply realizes
the greatness of God is also counted amongst the neophytes. Such
beginners can be elevated to the second-class or first-class platform
if they associate with pure devotees.

An example of the neophyte class is Maharaj Dhruva. He was in

need of his father's kingdom and therefore engaged himself in devo­

tional service to the Lord. Then in the end when he was completely

purified he declined to accept any material benediction from the
Lord. Similarly, Gaj endra was also distressed and prayed to Krgm

for protection, after which he became . a pure devotee. Similarly,

Sanaka, Sanatana, Sananda and Sanat-kumara were all in the category

of wise, saintly persons, and they were also attracted by devo­

tional service. A similar thing happened to the assemblage in the
N aimi�ara!lya forest, headed by the sage Saunaka. They were inquisi­

tive and were always asking Siita Gosvami about Kr9!1a. Thus they

achieved the association of a pure devotee and became pure devotees

themselves. So that is the way of elevating oneself. In whatever con­

dition one may be, if he is fortunate enough to associate with pure

devotees, then very quickly he is elevated to the second-class or first­
class platform.

These four types of devotees have been described in
' the Seventh

Chapter of the Bhagavad-gitii, and they have all been accepted as

pious. Without becoming pious no one can come to devotional ser­

vice. It is explained in the Bhagavad-gitii that only one who has con­

tinually executed pious activities and whose sinful reactions in life

have completely stopped can take to Kr9!1a consciousness. Others

cannot. The neophyte devotees are classified into four groups-the

distressed, those in need of money, the inquisitive and the wise-ac­

cording to their gradations of pious activities. Without pious activi­

ties, if a man is in a distressed condition h_e becomes an agnostic,

communist or something like that. Because he does not firmly believe

in God, he thinks that he can adj ust his distressed condition by
totally disbelieving in Him.

Lord Kr9!!a, however, has explained in the Gitii that out of these

four types of neophytes, the one who is wise is very dear to Him be­

cause a wise man, if he is attached to Kr9p.a, is not seeking an ex-

Eligibility of the Candidate for Accepting Devotional Service

31

change of material benefits. A wise man who becomes attached to
Krwa does not want any return from Him, neither in the form of re­
lieving distress, nor in gaining money. This means that from the very
beginning his basic principle of attachment to Kr�pa is, more or less,
love. Furthermore, due to his wisdom and study of siistras (scrip­
tures), he can understand also that Kr�pa is the Supreme Personality
of Godhead.
It is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gitii that after many, many births,
when one becomes actually wise, he surrenders unto Vasudeva,
knowing perfectly well that Kr�!la (Vasudeva) is the origin and cause
of all causes. Therefore,

he sticks to the lotus feet of Krwa and

gradually develops love for Him. Although such a wise man is very
dear to Kr�!la, the others are also accepted as very magnanimous
because even though they are distressed or in need of money, they
have come to Kr�!la for satisfaction. Thus they are accepted as lib­
eral, broad-minded mahiitmiis.
Without being elevated to the position of a jiiiini, or wise man,
no one can stick to the principle of worshiping the Supreme Per­
sonality of Godhead. Others who are less intelligent, or those whose
intelligence has been taken away by the spell of miiyii, are attached
to different demigods, on account of the influence of the modes of
nature. The wise man is he who has thoroughly understood that he is
spirit soul and not simply a body. Because he realizes that he is spirit
and that Kr�!la is the supreme spirit, he knows that his intimate
relationship should be with Krwa, not with this body. The distressed
and the man in want of money are in the material concept of life
because distress and need of money are both in relationship with this
body. One who is inquisitive may be a little above the distressed and
the man in need of money, but still he is on the material platform.
But a wise man who seeks Kr�!la knows perfectly well that he is spirit
soul, or Brahman, and that Kr�!la is the supreme spirit soul, or Param­

Brahman. He knows that the spirit soul, being subordinate and finite,
should always dovetail himself with the infinite and supreme soul,
Krwa. That is the relationship of the wise man with Kr�pa.
It can be concluded that a person who is freed from the bodily
concept of life is an eligible candidate for pure devotional service. It

32

The Nectar of Devotion

is also confirmed in the Bhagavad-gitii that after Brahman realization,

when one is freed from material anxieties and can see every living
entity on an equal level, he is eligible to enter into devotional service.
As has been stated before, there are three kinds of happiness:

material, spiritual and devotional. Devotional service and the happi­

ness due to its execution are not possible so long as one is materially

affected. If someone has desire for material enjoyment or for be­

coming one with the supreme, these are both considered material con­
cepts. Because the impersonalists cannot appreciate the spiritual hap­

piness of association and the exchange of loving affairs with the Su­

preme Personality of Godhead, their ultimate goal is to hecome one
with the Lord. This concept is simply an extension of the material

idea. In the material world, everyone is trying to be the topmost head­

man amongst all his fellow men or neighbors. Either communally,

socially or nationally, everyone is competing to be greater than all

others, in the material concept of life. This greatness can be extended
to the unlimited, so that one actually wants to become one with the
greatest of all, the Supreme Lord. This is also a material concept,

although maybe a little more advanced.

However, the perfect spiritual concept of life is complete know­

ledge of one's constitutional position, and thus one knows enough to

dovetail himself in the transcendental loving service to the Lord. One

must know that he is finite and that the Lord is infinite. Thus it is
not possible to actually become one with the Lord even if one aspires

for this. It is simply not possible. Therefore, anyone who has any
desire or aspiration for satisfying his senses by becoming more and

more important, either in the material sense or in the spiritual sense,

cannot actually relish the really sweet taste of devotional service.
Snl.a Rupa Gosvami has therefore compared possessing these bhukti

(material) and mukti (liberation) desires with being influenced by the

black art of a witch: in both cases one is in trouble. Bhukti means

material enjoyment, and mukti means to become freed from material

anxiety and to become one with the Lord. These desires are compared

to being haunted by ghosts and witches, because while these aspira­

tions for material enjoyment or spiritual oneness with the supreme

Eligibility of the Candidate for Accepting Devotional Service

33

remain, no one can relish the actual transcendental taste of devo­

tional service.

A pure devotee never cares for liberation. Lord Caitanya Maha­

prabhu prayed to Kr�:ra: "My dear son of Nanda, I do not want any
material happiness in the shape of many followers, nor immense

opulence in wealth, nor any beautiful wife, nor do I want cessation
from material existence. I may take birth many times, one after

another, but what I pray from You is that my devotion unto You
may always remain unflinching."

The attention of a pure devotee is so much attracted to glorifica­

tion of the pastimes, name, qualities, forms, etc., of the Lord that
the devotee does not care for mukti. Sri Bilvamailgala Thakur has

said, "If I am engaged in devotional service unto You, my dear
Lord, then very easily can I perceive Your presence everywhere.

And as far as liberation is concerned, I think liberation stands at my
door with folded hands waiting to serve me." To pure devotees,
therefore, liberation and spiritual emancipation are not very impor­

tant things.

In this connection, in the Third Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam,

Chapter 25, verse 23, Kapiladeva has advised His mother, Devahuti,

as follows: "My dear Mother, My pure devotees are charmed by

seeing My different forms, the beauty of My face, the structure of

My body so enchanting. My laughing, My pastimes and My glance
appear to them so beautiful that their minds are always absorbed

in thoughts of Me, and their lives are dedicated fully unto Me. Al­

though such people do not desire any kind of liberation or any kind

of material happiness, still I give them a place amongst My associates
in the supreme abode."

This evidence from Srimad-Bhiigavatam gives assurance to the pure

devotee of being elevated to association with the Supreme Personality

of Godhead. Snl.a Rupa Gosvami remarks in this connection that

one who is actually attracted by the beauty of the lotus feet of

Sri Kr�:ra or His service, and whose heart, by such attraction, is

always full with transcendental bliss, will naturally never aspire after
the liberation which is so valuable to the impersonalists.

A similar passage is also there in the Third Canto, 15th Chapter, of

34

The Nectar of Devotion

the same book, wherein Uddhava addresses Lord Kr�t;ta and says,
"My dear Lord, for persons who are engaged in Your transcendental
loving service there is nothing worth obtaining from religiousness,
economic development, sense gratification or liberation-although
happiness from these different sources can be very easily had by
them. In spite of such facilities, my dear Lord, I do not aspire to
achieve any such results. My only prayer is that I may have un­
flinching faith and devotion unto Your lotus feet."
A similar passage appears in the Third Canto, 25th Chapter, 31st
verse, wherein Kapiladeva instructs His mother and says, "My dear
Mother, devotees whose hearts are always filled in the service of My
lotus feet, and who are prepared to do anything for My satisfaction,
especially those who assemble together to understand My qualities,
pastimes and form, and thus glorify Me congregationally and derive
transcendental pleasure therefrom, such fortunate devotees never de­
sire to become one with Me. And not to speak of becoming one with
Me, if they are offered a post like Mine in My abode, or opulence
like Mine, or even personal association with Me with similar bodily
features, they refuse to accept because they are satisfied simply by
being engaged in My devotional service."

In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, Fourth Canto, 9th Chapter, lOth verse,

King Dhruva says, "My dear Lord, the transcendental pleasure de­
rived by meditation upon Your lotus feet, which is enjoyed by the
pure devotees, cannot be approached by the transcendental pleasure
derived by the impersonalists through self realization. So how can the
fruitive workers, who at most can aspire to promotion to the higher
heavenly planets, understand You, and how can they be described as
enjoying a happiness similar to the devotees' happiness?"

4 I Devotional Service
Surpasses All Liberation

How much a devotee is seriously attached to the devotional service

of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can be understood from the

statement of Mahariij Prthu (Adiraja) which is described in Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, Fourth Canto, 20th Chapter, 21st verse. He prays to
the Supreme Personality of Godhead thusly: "My dear Lord, if after

taking liberation I have no chance of hearing the glories of Your
Lordship, glories chanted by pure devotees from the core of their

hearts in praise of Your lotus feet, and if I have no chance for this
honey of transcendental bliss, then I shall never ask for liberation

or this so-called spiritual emancipation. I shall simply always pray

unto Your Lordship that You may give me millions of tongues and

millions of ears so that I can constantly chant and hear of Your

transcendental glories."

The impersonalists desire to merge into the existence of the su­

preme, but without keeping their individuality they have no chance

of hearing and chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord. Because
they have no idea of the transcendental form of the Supreme Lord

there is no chance of their chanting and hearing of His transcendental

activities. In other words, unless one is already beyond liberation,

one cannot relish the transcendental glories of the Lord, nor can one

understand the transcendental form of the Lord.

A similar statement is found in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, Fifth Can­

to, 14th Chapter, 43rd verse. Sukadeva Gosvami addresses

Parik�it

Mahiiriij there and says, "The great soul of King Bharata was so much
attached to the service of the lotus feet of Krwa that he very easily

gave up his lordship over the earthly planet and his affection for his

35

The Nectar of Devotion

36

children, society, friends, royal opulence and beautiful wife. He was
so very lucky that the goddess of fortune was pleased to offer him all
kinds of material concessions, but he never accepted any of these ma­

terial opulences." Sukadeva Gosvami' eulogizes this behavior of King
Bharata very highly. He says, "Any person whose heart is attracted
by the transcendental qualities of the Supreme Personality of God­
head, Madhusiidana, not to speak of material opulences, does not
care even for that liberation which is aspired to by many great sages."

In the Bhiigavatam, Sixth Canto, 11th Chapter, 23rd verse, there is

a similar statement by Vrtrasura, who addresses the Lord as follows:
"My dear Lord, by leaving Your transcendental service I may be pro­
moted to the planet called Dhruva-loka [the Pole Star], or I may
gain lordship over all the planetary systems of the universe. But I do

not aspire to this. Nor do I wish the mystic perfections of yoga prac­

tice, nor do I aspire to spiritual emancipation. All I wish for, my
Lord, is Your association and transcendental service eternally."
This statement is confirmed by Lord Siva in the Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, Sixth Canto, 17th Chapter, 52nd verse, wherein Lord
Siva addresses Sati' thusly: "My dear Sati', persons who are devoted to
Naraya�a [ Kr��a] are not afraid of anything. If they are elevated to
the higher planetary systems, or if they get liberation from material
contamination, or if they are pushed down to the hellish condition
of life-or, in fact, in any situation whatever-they are not afraid of
anything. Simply because they have taken shelter of the lotus feet of
Naraya�a, for them any position in the material world is as good as
another."
There is a similar statement by Indra, the King of heaven, in

Srimad-Bhiigavatam, Sixth Canto, 18th Chapter, 52nd verse. There
Indra addresses his mother in this manner: "My dear Mother [Aditi],

persons who have given up all kinds of desire and are simply engaged
in devotional service to the Lord know what is actually their self­
interest. Such persons are actually serving their self-interests and are
considered first-class experts in the matter of advancing to the perfectional stage of life."

In the Seventh Canto of the Bhiigavatam, 6th. Chapter, 23rd verse,

Maharaj Prahlada says: "My dear friends who are born into atheistic

--.::

Devotional Service Surpasses All Liberation

37

families, if you can please the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Kr�!la, then there is nothing more rare in this world. In other words,
if the Supreme Lord Kr�!la is pleased with you, then any desire that
you may have within the core of your heart can be fulfilled without
any doubt. As such, what is the use of elevating yourself by the re­
sults of fruitive activities, which are automatically achieved in all
events by the modes of material nature? And what is the use for you
of spiritual emancipation or liberation from material bondage? If you
are always engaged in chanting the glories of the Supreme Lord and
- always relishing the nectar of the lotus feet of the Lord, then there is
no necessity for any of these." By this statement of PrahHida Maha­
raj it is clearly understood that one who takes pleasure in chanting
and hearing the transcendental glories of the Lord has already sur­
passed all kinds of material benedictions, including the results of
pious fruitive activities, sacrifices and even liberation from material
bondage.
Similarly, in the same Seventh Canto, 8th Chapter, 39th verse,
when the demigQdS are offering prayers to Lord Nrsi:rhha, lndra, the
King of heaven, says, "0 Supreme One, these demons talk of our
share of participation in the performances of ritualistic sacrifices, but
simply by Your appearance as Lord Nrsi:rhhadeva You have saved us
from terrible fears. Actually, our shares in the sacrificial performances
are due to You only, because You are the supreme enjoyer of all sac­
rifices. You are the su persoul of every living entity, and therefore
You are the actual owner of everything. Long were our hearts always
filled with fear of this demon, Hira!lyakasipu. But You are so kind
towards us that, by killing him, You have removed that fear from
within our hearts and have given us the chance to place Your Lord­
ship within our hearts again. For persons who are engaged in the
transcendental loving service of Your Lordship, all the opulences
which were taken away from us by the demons are counted as no­
thing. Devotees do not care even for liberation, not to speak of these
material opulences. Actually, we are not enjoyers of the fruits of sac­
rifices. Our only duty is to always be engaged in Your service, for
You are the enjoyer of everything."
The purport of this statement by lndra is that, beginning from

38

The Nectar of DevQtion

Brahma down to the insignificant ant, no living entities are meant for
enjoying the material opulences. They are simply meant for offering
everything to the supreme proprietor, the Personality of Godhead.
By doing so, they automatically enjoy the benefit. The example can
be cited again of the different parts of the body collecting foodstuffs
and cooking them so that ultimately a meal may be offered to the
stomach. After it has gone to the stomach, all the parts of the body
equally enjoy the benefit of the meal. So, similarly, everyone's duty
is to satisfy the Supreme Lord, and then automatically everyone will
become satisfied.
A similar verse is found in the Eighth Canto, 3rd Chapter, of

Srimad-Bhiigavatam, verse 20. Gajendra says there, "My dear Lord, I
have no experience in the transcendental bliss derived from Your de­

votional service, so therefore I have asked from You some favor. But
I know that persons who are pure devotees and have, by serving the
lotus feet of great souls, become freed from all material desires, are
always merged in the ocean of transcendental bliss and, as such, are
always satisfied simply by glorifying Your auspicious characteristics.
For them there is nothing else to aspire to or pray for."

In the Ninth Canto of the Bhiigavatam, 4th Chapter, 49th verse,

the lord of Vaiku�tha replies to Durvasa Muni thusly: "My pure devo­
tees are always satisfied being engaged in devotional service, and
therefore they do not aspire even after the five liberated stages,
which are l) to be one with Me, 2)to achieve residence on My plan­
et,

3) to have My opulences, 4) to possess bodily features similar to

Mine and 5) to gain personal association with Me. So, when they are
not interested even in these liberated positions, you can know how
little they care for material opulences or material liberation."

There is a similar prayer b y the niigapatni (wives of the Kaliya ser­
pent), in the Tenth Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, 16th Chapter, verse

33. The niigapatni say there, "My dear Lord, the dust of Your lotus
feet is very wonderful. Any person who is fortunate enough to achieve
this dust does not care for heavenly planets, lordship over all the plan­

etary systems, the mystic perfections of yoga or even liberation from
material existence. In other words, anyone who adores the dust of
Your lotus feet does not care a fig for all other perfectional stages."

1
Devotional Service Surpasses All Liberation

39

There is a similar statement in the Tenth Canto, 87th Chapter,

17th verse, when the Srutis, the Vedas personified, prayed to the
Lord as follows: "My dear Lord, it is very difficult to understand

spiritual knowledge.

Your appearance here just as You are, is to

explain to us this most difficult subject of knowledge of the spirit.

As such, Your devotees who have left their domestic comforts to
associate with the liberated iiciiryas [teachers] are now fully merged

in the devotional service of Your Lordship, and thus they do not
care for any so-called liberation.,-

In explaining this verse it should be noted that spiritual knowledge

means understanding the self and the supersoul, or superself. The

individual soul and the supersoul are qualitatively one, and therefore

both of them are known as Brahman, or spirit- But knowledge of

Brahman is very difficult to understand. There are so many philoso­

phers engaged in the matter of understanding the soul, but they are

unable to make any tangible advancement. It is confirmed in the

Bhagavad-gitii that out of many millions of persons, only one may
try to understand what is spiritual knowledge, and out of many

such persons who are trying to understand, only one or a few may
know what is the Supreme Personality of Godhead. So this verse

says that spiritual knowledge is very difficult to achieve, and so

in order to make it more easily attainable, the Supreme Lord Himself
comes in His original form as Sri Kr��a and gives His instruction

directly to an associate like Arjuna, just so that the people in general

may take advantage of this spiritual knowledge. This verse also
explains that

liberation means having completely

given

up all

the material comforts of life. Those who are impersonalists are

satisfied by simply being liberated from the material circumstances,

but those who are devotees can automatically give up material life

and also enjoy the transcendental bliss of hearing and chanting the

wonderful activities of Lord Krsna.

In the Eleventh Canto of Srf�q,d-Bhiigavatam; 20t� Chapter, 34th

verse, Lord Kr��a says to Uddhava as follows: '\My dear Uddhava,

the devotees who have completely taken shelter of My service are so

steadfast in devotional service that they have no other desire. Even

The Nectar of Devotion

40

if they are offered the four kinds of spiritual opulences,* they will

refuse to accept them. So what to. speak of their desiring anything

within the material world!" Similarly, Lord Krgta says in another
passage of the Bhiigavatam, Eleventh Canto, 14th Chapter, 13th

verse, "My dear Uddhava, a person whose consciousness is completely

absorbed in My thought and activities does not aspire even to occupy
the post of Brahma, or the post of Indra, or the post of lordship over
the planets, or the eight kinds of mystic perfections, or even libera­
tion itself." In the Twelfth Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam,

lOth

Chapter, verse 6, Lord Siva says to Devi: "My dear Devi, this great
briihmar-a

sage Marka��eya has

attained unflinching

faith and

devotion unto the S�preme Personality of Godhead, and as such

he does not aspire after any benedictions, inctuding liberation from

the material world."

Similarly, there is a statement in Padma Purar-a describing the
ritualistic function during the month of Kiirttika (October-Novem­

ber). During this month, in Vrndavana it is the regulative principle

to pray daily to Lord Kr��a in His Damodara form. The Damodara

form refers to Kr��a in His childhood when He was tied up with rope
by His mother, Yasoda. Diima means ropes, and udara means the

abdomen. So Mother Y asoda, being very disturbed by naughty

Kr��a, bound Him round the abdomen with a rope, and thus Krwa

is named Diimodara. During the month of Kiirttika, Damodara is

prayed to as follows: "My dear Lord, You are the Lord of all,
the giver of all benedictions." There are many demigods like Lord

Brahma and Lord Siva who sometimes offer benedictions to their

respective devotees. For example, Ravana was blest with many

benedictions by Lord Siva, and Hira�yakasipu was blest by Lord

Brahma. But even Lord Siva and Lord Brahma depend upon the
benedictions of Lord Kr��a, and therefore Krwa is addressed as the

Lord of all benefactors. As such, Lord Kr��a can offer His devotees

anything they want, but still, the devotee's prayer continues, "I do

not ask You for liberation or any material facility up to the point
of liberation. What I want as Your favor is that I may always think of
*The fifth kind of liberation, merging with the Supreme, is not considered an

opulence in spiritual variegated existence.

Devotional Service Surpasses All Liberation

41

Your form as I see You now as Damodara. You are so beautiful and
attractive that my mind does not want anything else besides this
wonderful form." In this same prayer, there is another passage in
which it is said, "My dear Lord Damodara, once when You were
playing as a naughty boy in the house of Nanda Maharaj, You broke
the box containing yogurt, and because of that Mother Yasoda
considered You an offender and tied You with rope to the household
grinding mortar. At that time You delivered two sons of Kuvera,
Nalakiivara and Manigriva, who were staying there as two arjuna
trees in the yard of Nanda Maharaj. My only request is that by
Your merciful pastimes You may similarly deliver me."
The story behind this verse is that the two sons of Kuvera (the
treasurer of the demigods) were puffed up on account of the opu­
lence of their father, and so once on a heavenly planet they were
enjoying themselves in a lake with some naked damsels of heaven.
At that time the great saint Narada Muni was passing on the road and
was sorry to see the behavior of the sons of Kuvera. Seeing Narada
passing by, the damsels of heaven covered their bodies with cloth,
but the two sons, being drunkards, did not have this decency. Narada
became angry with their behavior and cursed them thusly: "You have
no sense, so it is better if you become trees instead of the sons of
Kuvera." Upon hearing this, the boys came to their senses and begged
Narada to be pardoned for their offenses. Narada then said, "Yes,
you shall become trees, arjuna trees, and you will stand at the
courtyard of Nanda Maharaj. But Kr�t�-a Himself will appear in time
as the foster son of Nanda, and He will deliver you." In other words,
the curse of Narada was a benediction to the sons of Kuvera because
indirectly it was foretold that they would be able to receive the
favor of Lord Kr�tJ.a. After that, Kuvera's two sons stood as two
big arjuna trees in the courtyard of Nanda Maharaj until Lord
Damodara, in order to fulfill the desire of Narada, dragged the·
milling pestle to which He was tied and struck the two trees,
violently causing them to fall down. From out of these fallen trees
came Nalakiivara and Mat�-igriva, who had by then become great
devotees of the Lord.
There is a passage in the llayasir§a Puriir-a which states, "My

42

The Nectar of Devotion

dear Lord, 0 Supreme Personality of Godhead, I do not want any
resultant benediction from my religious life, nor do I want any
economic development, nor do I want to enjoy sense gratification,

nor liberation. I simply pray to he an eternal servant at Your lotus
..
feet. Kindly oblige me and give me this benediction."

In the same Hayasir§a Purii:l)a, after Nrsimhadeva wanted to give

benediction to

PrahHida

Mahiiraj,

Prahlada

did not accept any

material benediction and simply asked the favor of the Lord to

remain His eternal devotee. In this connection, Prahlada Maharaj
cited

the

example of

Hanuman,

the eternal servitor of

Lord

Ramacandra, who also set an example by neve� asking any material

favor from the Lord. He always remained engaged in His service.
That is the ideal character of Hanuman, for which he is still wor­

shiped by all devotees. Prahlada Maharaj also offered his respectful

obeisances unto Hanuman. There is a well-known verse spoken by
Hanuman in which he says, "My dear Lord, if You like You can give

me salvation from this material existence, or the privilege of merging
into Your existence, but I do not wish any of these things. I do

not want anything which diminishes my relationship with You as

master and servant, even after liberation."

In a similar passage in Niirada-paficariitra it is stated, "My dear

Lord, I do not wish any perfectional stage by performing the ritualis­

tic religious ceremonies or by economic development or by sense

gratification or liberation. I simply pray that You grant me the favor

of keeping me under Your lotus feet. I do not wish any kind of

liberation such as siilohya, to reside on Your planet, or siiriipya, to

have the same bodily features as You. I simply pray for Your favor

that I may be always engaged in Your loving service."

Similarly, in the Sixth Canto, 14th Chapter, 4th verse of Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, l\'laharaj Parilqit inquires from Sukadeva Gosvami:, "My

dear briihmara, I understand that the demon Vrtrasura was a great

sinful person and that his mentality was completely absorbed in the
modes of passion and ignorance. How did he develop to such a
perfectional stage of devotional service to Naraya�a? I have heard

that even great persons who have undergone severe austerities and

who are _liberated with full knowledge must strive to become

Devotional Service Surpasses All Liberation

43

devotees of the Lord. It is understood that such persons are very
rare and almost never to be seen, so I am astonished that V rtrasura
has become such a devotee!"
In the above verse, the most important thing to be noted is that
there may be many liberated persons who might have merged into

the existence of the impersonal Brahman, but a devotee of the
Supreme

Personality

of Godhead, Narayat:la, is very, very rare.

Even out of millions of liberated persons, only one is fortunate
enough to become a devotee.

In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam,

First

Canto, 7th Chapter, Queen

Kunti is praying to Lord Kr�t:la at the time of His departure: "My
dear Kr�t:la, You are so great that You are inconceivable even to great

stalwart scholars and paramaharhsas [fully liberated souls]. So if
such great sages, who are transcendental to all the reactions of
material existence, are unable to know You, then as far as we are

concerned, belonging to the less intelligent woman class, how is it
possible for us to know Your glories? How can we understand You?"
In this verse, the particular thing to be noted is that the Personality
of Godhead is not understood by great liberated persons, but only
by devotees such as Queen Kunti in her humbleness. Although
she was a woman and considered less intelligent than a man, still
she realized the glories of Kr�t:la. That is the purport of this verse.
passage which is very important is in the Srimad­
·
Bhiigavatam, First canto, 6th Chapter, lOth verse, and is called the
Another

"iitmiiriima verse." In this iitmiiriima verse it is stated that even those

who are completely liberated from material contamination are at­
tracted by the transcendental qualities of Lord Kr�I;la. * The purport
of this verse is that a liberated soul has absolutely no desire at all for
material enjoyment; he is wholly freed from all kinds of material
desires, yet still he is irresistibly attracted by the desire to hear and
"
understand the pastimes of the Lord. We can therefore conclude that
the glories and pastimes of the Lord are not material. Otherwise, how
*This atmiiriima verse was once nicely explained by Lord Caitanya to Sanatana
Gosvami. There is a detailed explanation of this verse in the author's Teachings
of Lord Caitanya.

44

The Nectar of Devotion

could the liberated persons known as iitmiiriimas be attracted by
such pastimes? That is the important point in this verse.
From the above statement it is found that a devotee is not after
any of the stages of liberation. There are five stages of liberation,
"

I

already explained as being

l) to b.,ecome one with the Lord, 2) to

live on the same planet as the Lord, 3) to obtain the same bodily
features as the Lord, 4) to have the same opulences as the Lord and

5) to have constant association with the Lord. Out of these five
liberated stages the one which is known as siiyujya, or to merge
into the existence of the Lord, is the last to be accepted by a
devotee. The other four liberations, although not desired by devotees,
still are not against the devotional ideals. So.me of the liberated
persons who have achieved these four stages of liberation may also
develop affection for Kr9!la and be promoted to the Goloka Vrn­
davana planet in the spiritual sky. In other words, those who are
already promoted to the Vaiku!ltha planets and possess the four kinds
of liberation may also sometimes develop affection for Kr9!la and
become promoted to Kr9!la-loka.
So those who are in the four liberated states may still be going
through different stages of existence. In the beginning they may
want the opulences of Kr9!la, but at the mature stage the dormant
love for Kr9!la exhibited in Vrndavana becomes prominent in their
hearts. As such, the pure devotees never accept the liberation of

siiyujya, to become one with the supreme, though sometimes they

may accept as favorable the other four liberated states.

Out of many kinds of devotees of the Supreme Personality of God­

head, the one who is attracted to the original form of the Lord, Krwa

in Vrndavana, is considered to be the foremost, first-class devotee.

Such a devotee is never attracted by the opulences of Vaiku!ltha, nor

even of Dvaraka, the royal city where KH!la ruled. The conclusion of
Sri Riipa Gosvami is that the devotees who are attracted by the pas­

times of the Lord in Gokula, or Vrn davana,* are the topmost devotees.

*Vrndavana is the transcendental place where Krwa enj oys His eternal pastimes
as

a boy, and it is considered the topmost sphere in all existence. When this is ex­

hibited in the material world the place is called Gokula, and in the spiritual world
it is called Goloka or Goloka Vrndavana.

Devotional Service Surpasses All Liberation

45

A devotee who is attached fo a particular form of the Lord does
not wish to change his devotion to other forms. For example,
Hanuman, the devotee of Lord Ramacandra, knew that there is no
difference between Lord Ramacandra and Lord Naraya�a, and yet
he still wanted to render service only unto Lord Ramacandra. That is
due to the specific attraction of a particular devotee. There are
many, many forms of the Lord, but Kr��a is still the original form.
Though all of the devotees of the different forms of the Lord are in
the same category, still it is said that those who are devotees of Lord
Kr��a are the topmost in the list of all devotees.

:

5 I Purity of Devotional Service

All of the previous instructions imparted by S rila Riipa Gosvami in
his broad statements can be summarized thusly: as long as one is ma­
terially inclined or desirous to merge into the. spiritual effulgence,
one cannot enter into the realm of pure devotional service. Next,
Riipa Gosvami states that devotional service is transcendental to all
material considerations and that it is not limited to any particular
country, class, society or circumstance. As is stated in the Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, devotional service is transcendental and has no cause.

Devotional service is executed without any hope for gain, and it can­
not be checked by any material circumstances. It is open for all,
without any distinction, and it is the constitutional occupation of the
·

living entities.

In the Middle Ages, after the disappearance of Lord Caitanya's
great associate Lord Nityananda, a class of priestly persons claimed
to be the descendents of Nityananda, calling themselves the gosviimi
caste. They further claimed that the practice and spreading of devo­
tional service belonged only to their particular class, which was
known as Nityiinanda-vamsa. In this way, they exercised their arti­

ficial power for some time, until

S rila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati

Thakur, the powerful iiciirya of the Gaufliya Vai§rtava sampradiiya,

completely smashed their idea. There was a great hard struggle for
some time, but it has turned out successfully, and it is now correctly
and practically established that devotional service is not restricted to
a particular class of men. Besides that, anyone who is engaged in
devotional service is already on the status of being a high-class briih­

mar-a. So

S rila Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati Thakur's struggle for this

movement has come out successful.
46

Purity of Devotional Service

47

It is on the basis of his position that anyone can now become a

Gaw}iya Vai§r-ava, from any part of the world or any part of the uni­

verse. Anyone who is a pure Vai§r-ava is situated transcendentally,

and therefore the highest qualification in the material world, namely,

to be in the modes of goodness, is already achieved by such a person.
Our Krsna consciousness movement in the Western world is based on
·
the ab ��e-mentioned proposition of Snla Bhaktisiddhanta Sarasvati

Gosvami Prabhupada, our spiritual master. On his authority, we are

claiming members from all sections of the Western countries. The so­

called briihmar-as claim that one who is not born into a briihmar-a

family cannot receive the sacred thread and cannot become a high­

grade Vai§r-ava. But we do not accept such a theory because it is not

supported by Rupa Gosvami nor by the strength of the various scrip­
tures.

Snla Ri1pa Gosvami specifically mentions herein that every man

has the birthright to accept devotional service and to become Kr��a

conscious. He has given many evidences from many scriptures, and

he has especially quoted one passage from Padma Puriirw, wherein

sage Vasi�tha tells King Dilipa: "My dear King, everyone has the right

to execute devotional service, just as he has the right to take early

bath in the month of Miigh [December-} anuary]." There is more

evidence in Padma Puriir-a, in the Kiisikhar-�a portion, where it is

said: "In the country known as Mayuradhvaja, the lower caste people

who are considered less than sudras are also initiated in the Vai§r-ava
cult of devotional service. And when. they are properly dressed, with
tilaka on their bodies and beads in their hands and on their necks,

they appear to be coming from Vaiku�tha. In fact, they look so very
beautiful that immediately they surpass the ordinary briihmar-as."

Thus a Vai§r-ava automatically becomes a briihmar-a. This idea is also

supported by Sanatana Gosvami iu his book Hari-bhakti-viliisa, which

is the Vai§r-ava guide. Therein he has clearly stated that any person who
is properly initiated into the

Vai§r-ava cult certainly becomes a

briihmar-a, as much as the metal known as kamsa (bell metal) is turned

into gold by the mixture of mercury. A bona fide spiritual master, under

the guidance of authorities, can turn anyone to the Vai§r-ava cult so
that naturally he may come to the topmost position of a briihmar-a.

48

The Nectar of Devotion
Srila Riipa Gosvami warns, however, that if a person is properly

initiated by a bona fide spiritual master, he should not think that sim­

ply by the acceptance of such initiation his business is then finished.

One still has to follow the rules and regulations very carefully. If

after accepting the spiritual master.,and being initiated one does not

follow the rules and regulations of devotional service, then he is again

fallen. One must be very vigilant to remember that he is the part and
parcel of the transcendental body of Krwa, and it is his duty as part

and parcel to give service to the whole, or Kr��a. If we do not render
service to Kn;�a then again we fall down. In other words, simply be­

coming initiated does not elevate one to the position of a high-class

briihmar-a. One also has to discharge the duties and follow the regu­

lative principles very rigidly.

Sri Riipa Gosvami also says that if anyone is regularly discharging

devotional service there will be no question of a falldown. But even

if circumstantially there is some falldown, the Vai§r-ava need have

nothing to do with the priiyascitta, the ritualistic ceremony for puri­
fication. If someone falls down from the principles of devotional
service, he need not take to the priiyascitta performances for refor­

mation. He has simply to execute the rules and regulations for dis­

charging devotional service, and that is sufficient for his reinstate­

ment. This is the mystery of the Vai§rwva (devotional) cult.

Practically there are three processes for elevating one to the plat­

form of spiritual consciousness. These processes are called karma,

jniina and bhakti. Ritualistic performances are in the field of karma.

Speculative processes are in the field of jniina. One who has taken to

bhakti, the devotional service of the Lord, need have nothing to do
with karma or jniina. It has been already explained that pure devo­

tional service is without any tinge of karma or jniina. Bhak ti should
have no tinge of philosophical speculation or ritualistic performances.
In this connection

Srila Riipa Gosvami gives evidence from

Srimad-Bhiigavatam, Eleventh Canto, in which it is said by Lord
Kr��a to Uddhava, "The distinction between qualification and dis­

qualification may be made in this way: persons who are already ele­
vated in discharging devotional service will never again take shelter of

the processes of fruitive activities or philosophical speculation. If one

Purity of Devotional Service

49

sticks to devotional service and is conducted by regulative principles

given by the authorities and iiciiryas, that is the best qualification."

This statement is supported in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, First Can­

to, 5th Chapter, 17th verse, wherein Sri Narada Muni advises Vyasa­

deva thusly: "Even if one does not execute his specific occupational

duty, but immediately takes direct shelter of the lotus feet of Hari

[ Kr�rta] , there will be no fault on his part, and in all circumstances

his position is secure. Even if, by some bad association, he falls down
while executing devotional service, or if he doesn't finish the com­

plete course of devotional service and dies untimely, still he is not at
a loss. A person who is simply discharging his occupational duty in

varrw and iisrama, however, with no Kr� rta consciousness, practically

does not gain the true benefit of human life." The purport is that all
conditioned souls who are engaged very frantically in activities for
sense gratification, without knowing that this process will never help
them to get out of material contamination, are awarded only with
repeated births and deaths.

In the Fifth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam it is clearly stated by

J;t�abhadeva to his sons: "Persons engaged in fruitive activities are re­

peatedly accepting birth and death, and until they develop a loving
feeling for Vasudeva, there will be no question of getting out from
these stringent laws of material nature." As such, any person who

is very seriously engaged in his occupational duties in the vaqws and

iisramas, and who does not develop love for the Supreme Personality

of Godhead, Vasudeva, is to be understood as simply spoiling his
human form of life.
This

is

confirmed

also

in

the

Eleventh

Canto

of Srimad­

Bhagavatam, llth Chapter, 32nd verse, in which the Lord says to

Uddhava, "My dear Uddhava, any person who takes shelter of Me in

complete surrender and followg; My instructions, giving up all occupa­

tional duties, is to be considered the first-class man." In this state­

ment of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it is understood that
people who are generally attracted to philanthropic, ethical, moral,

altruistic, political and social welfare activities may be considered
nice men only in the calculation of the material world. From Srimad­

Bhiigavatam and other authentic Vedic scriptures we learn further

50

The Nectar of Devotion

that if a person simply acts in Kr��a consciousness and discharges

devotional service, he is considered to be far, far better situated than
all of those persons engaged in philanthropic, ethical, moral, altruistic
and social welfare activities.

The same thing is still more emphatically confirmed in the Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, Eleventh Canto, 5th Chapter, 37th verse, in which

Karabhajana Muni addresses Maharaj Nimi as follows: "My dear
King, if somebody gives up his occupational duties as they are pre­

scribed for the different varr-as and iisramas, but takes complete shel­
ter, surrendering himself unto the lotus feet of the Lord, such a per­

son is no more a debtor, nor has he any obligation to perform the

different kinds of activities we render to the great sages, ancestors,

living entities and family and society members. Neither has he any
need to bother executing the five kinds of yajiias [sacrifices] for be­

coming free from sinful contamination. Simply by discharging devo­

tional service he is freed from all kinds of obligations." The purport

is that as soon as a man takes his birth, he is immediately indebted

to so many sources. He is indebted to the great sages because he
profits by reading their authoritative scriptures and books. For exam­

ple, we take advantage of the books written by Vyasadeva. Vyasa­
deva has left for us all the

Vedas. Before Vyasadeva's writing, the

Vedic literature was simply heard, and the disciples would learn the

mantras quickly by hearing and not by reading. Later on, Vyasadeva

thought it wise to write down the Vedas because in this age people

are short-memoried and unable to remember all the instructions
given by the spiritual master. Therefore, he left all the Vedic know­

ledge in book form, such as the Puriirws, Vedanta, Mahiibhiirata and
Srimad-Bhiigavatam.
There are many other sages, like Sankaracarya, Gautama Muni,

Narada Muni, etc., to whom we are indebted because we take

advantage of their knowledge. Similarly, we are obliged to our

.forefathers
where we

because we

take all

take

our

advantages

birth

in a

particular

family,

and inherit property. Therefore,

we are indebted to the forefathers and have to offer them piflfla

(prasiidam) after they are dead. Similarly, to the people in gen­

eral we are also indebted, as well as to our relatives, friends and

Purity of Devotional Service
even

animals

such

as

51

cows and dogs who render us so much

service.
In this way, we are indebted to the demigods, to the forefathers,
to the sages, to the animals and to society in general. It is our duty
to repay them all by proper discharge of service. But by the one
stroke of devotional service, if someone gives up all obligations and
simply surrenders unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead, he is no
longer a debtor, nor obliged to any other source of benefit.

In the Bhagavad-gitii also the Lord says: "Give up all your occu­

pations and just become surrendered unto Me. I give you assurance
that I shall give you protection from all sinful reactions." One may
think that because he is surrendering unto the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, he will not be able to perform all of his other obliga­
tions. But the Lord says repeatedly, "Don't hesitate. Don't consider
that because you are giving up all other engagements there will be
some flaw in your life. Don't think like that. I will give you all pro­

tection." That is the assurance of Lord Kr��a in the Bhagavad-gitii.

There is additional evidence in the Agastya-samhitii: "As the regu­

lative principles of scripture are not required by a liberated person,
similarly a person who is engaged duly in the service of Lord Rama­
candra is also not required to discharge the ritualistic principles
which are indicated in the Vedic supplimentaries." In other words,
the devotees of L.ord Ramacandra, or Krwa, are already liberated
persons and are not required to follow all the regulative principles
mentioned in the ritualistic portions of the Vedic literature.

Similarly, in the Eleventh Canto of Snmad-Bhiigavatam, 5th Chap­

ter, Karabhajana Muni addresses King Nimi and says, "My dear King,
a person who has given up the worship of the demigods and has com­
pletely concentrated his energy in the devotional service of the Su­
preme Personality of Godhelld has become very, very dear to the
Lord. As such, if by chance or mistake he does something which is
forbidden, there is no need for him to perform any purificatory
ceremonies. Because the Lord is situated within his heart, He takes
compassion for the devotee's accidental mistake and corrects him

from within." It is also confirmed in the Bhagavad-gitii in many

places that the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kr��a, takes a

...

52

The Nectar of Devotion

special interest in His devotees and declares emphatically that no­
thing can cause His devotees to fall dowri. He is always protecting
them.

6 I How to Discharge
Devotional Service

Srila Rfi.pa Gosvami states that his elder brother (Sanatana Go­

svami) has compiled Hari-bhakti-viliisa for the guidance of the Vai§­

r-avas, and therein has mentioned many rules and regulations to he

followed by the Vai§r-avas_ Some of them are very important and

prominent, and he will now mention these very important items for

our benefit. The purport of this statement is that Srila Rupa Gosvami
proposes to mention only basic principles, not details. For example,

a basic principle is that one has to accept a spiritual master. Exactly

how one follows the instructions of his spiritual master is considered

a detail. For example, if one is following the instruction of his spiri­

tual master and that instruction is different from the instructions of

another spiritual master, this is called detailed information. But the

basic principle of acceptance of a spiritual master is good everywhere,
'
although the details may be different. Srila Rupa Gosvami does not
wish to enter into details here, but he wants to place before us only
the principles.

He mentions the basic principles as follows: l) accepting the shel­

ter of the lotus feet of a bona fide spiritual master, 2) becoming ini­
tiated by the spiritual master and learning how to discharge devo­

tional service from him, 3) obeying the orders of the spiritual master

with faith and devotion,
iiciiryas (teachers)

5)

4) following in the footsteps of great

under the direction of the spiritual master,

inquiring from the spiritual master how to advance in Kr�!la

consciousness,

6) being prepared to give up anything material for

the satisfaction of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri Kr�!la

(This means that when we are engaged in the devotional service of

53

54

The Nectar of Devotion

Krwa, we must be prepared to give up something which we may not
like to give up, and also we have to accept something which we may
not like to accept.), 7) residing in a sacred place of pilgrimage like

Dvaraka or Vrndavana, 8) dealing with the material world only as

far as necessary, 9) observing the fasting day on Ekiidasi, and 10)
worshiping sacred trees like the banyan tree and others.

These ten items are preliminary necessities for beginning the
discharge of devotional service in regulative principles. In the be­

ginning, if a neophyte devotee observes the above-mentioned ten
principles, surely he will quickly make good advancement in Kr�!la

consciOusness.
The next set of instructions is listed as foll o ws: 1) One should

rigidly give up the company of nondevotees. 2) One should not in­
struct a person who is not desirous of accepting devotional service.

3) One should not be very enthusiastic about constructing costly
temples or monasteries. 4) One should not try to read too many
books, nor should one develop the id e a of earning his livelihood by

lecturing on or by professionally reciting Srimad-Bhiigavatam or the

Bhagavad-gitii. 5) One should not be neglectful in ordinary dealings.

6) One should not be under the spell of lamentation in loss or tribula­
tion in gain. 7) One should not disrespect the demigods. 8) One should
not give unnecessary trouble to any living entity. 9) One should
carefully avoid the various offenses in chanting the holy name of the
Lord, or in worshiping the Deity in the temple. 10) One should be

very intolerant towards the blasphemy of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, Kr�tta, or His devotees.

Without following the above-mentioned ten principles, one cannot

properly elevate himself to the platform of siidhana-bhakti, or devo­

tional service in practice. Altogether, Srila Riipa Gosvami mentions
twenty items, and all of them are very important. Out of the twenty,

the first three-namely, accepting the shelter of a bona fide spiritual
master, taking initiation from him and serving him with respect and
reverence-are the most important.

The next important items are as follows: 1) One should decorate

the body with tilaka, which is the sign of the Vai§[lavas. (The idea is

that as soon as a person sees these marks on the body of the Vai§[lava,

•
'

How to Discharge Devotional Service

55

he will immediately remember Kr��a. Lord Caitanya said that a
Vai§r-ava is he whom, when seen, reminds one of Kr��a. Therefore,
it is essential that a Vai§r-ava mark his body with tilaka to remind

2) In marking such tilaka, sometimes one may
write Ha re Kr§r-a on the body. 3) One should accept flowers and

others of Kr��a.)

garlands that have been offered to the Deity and the spiritual master
and put them on his body. 4) One should learn to dance before the
Deity.

5) One should learn to bow down immediately upon seeing
the Deity or the spiritual master. 6) As soon as one visits a temple of
Lord Kr��a, one must stand up. 7) When the Deity is being borne for
a stroll in the street, a devotee should immediately follow the
procession. (In this connection it may be noted that in India, espe­
cially in Vi��u, temples, the system is that apart from the big Deity
who is permanently situated in the main area of the temple, there
is another set of smaller Deities which are taken in procession in the
evening. In some temples it is the custom to hold a big procession
in the evening with a band playing and a nice big. umbrella over the
Deities, who sit on decorated thrones on the cart or palanquin which
is carried by devotees. The Deities come out onto the street and
travel in the neighborhood while the people of the neighborhood
come out to offer prasiidam. The residents of the neighborhood all
follow the procession so that it is a very nice scene. When the
Deity is coming Ol!t, the servitors in the temple put forward the
daily accounts before Them: so much was the collection, so much
was the expenditure. The whole idea is that the Deity is considered
to be the proprietor of the whole establishment, and all the priests
and other people taking care of the temple are considered to be the
servants of the Deity. This system is very, very old and is still
followed. So, therefore, it is mentioned here that when the Deity
is on stroll the people should follow behind.) 8) A devotee must
visit a Vi��u temple at least once or twice every day, morning and
evening. (In Vrndavana this system is followed very strictly. All the
devotees in town go every morning and evening to visit different
temples. Therefore during these times there are considerable crowds
all over the city. There.are about 5,000 temples in Vrndavana City.
Of course it is not possible to visit all the temples, but there are at

56

The Nectar of Devotion

least one dozen very big and important temples which were started
by the Gosvamis and which should be visited.)

9) One must cir­

cumambulate the temple building at least three times. (In every
temple there is an arrangement to go around the temple at least
three times. Some devotees go around more than three times:
ten times, fifteen times-according to their vows. The Gosvamis
used to circumambulate Govardhan Hill.) 10) One should circumam­
bulate the whole Vrndavana area. ll) One must worship the Deity
in the temple according to

the regulative principles. (Offering

iiriitrika, prasiidam, decorating the Deity, etc.-these things must be
observed regularly.) 12) Rendering personal service to the Deities.

13) Singing. 14) Sankirtana. 15) Chanting. 16) Offering prayers.
17) Reciting notable prayers. 18) Tasting mahii-prasiidam (food from
the very plate offered before the Deities). 19) Drinking carar-amrtam
(water from the bathing of the Deities which is offered to guests).

20) One must smell the incense and flowers offered to the Deity.
21) One must touch the lotus feet of the Deity. 22) One must see the
Deity with great devotion. 23) One must offer iiriitrika at different
times. 24) One must hear about the Lord and His pastimes from
Srimad-Bhiigavatam, the Bhagavad-gitii, and similar books. 25) One
must pray to the Deity for His mercy. 26) One should remember the
Deity. 27) One should meditate upon the Deity. 28) One should
render some voluntary service. 29) One should thipk of the Lord as
his friend. 30) One should offer everything to the Lord. 31) One
should offer a favorite article (as food or a garment). 32) One should
take all kinds of risks for Kr�!ia's benefit. 33) In every condition, be
a surrendered soul. 34) Pour water on the tulasi tree. 35) Regularly
hear Srimad-Bhiigavatam and similar literature. 36) Live in a sacred
place like Mathura, Vrndavana or Dvaraka. 37) Offer service to
Vai§r-avas (devotees). 38) Arrange your devotional service according
to your means. 39) In the month of Kiirttika (October and November),
make arrangements for special services. 40) During ]anmii§tami (the
time of Kr�!ia's appearance in this world) observe a special service.

41) Do whatever is done with great care and devotion for the Deity.
42) Relish the pleasure of Bhiigavatam reading amongst devotees and
not amongst outsiders. 43) Associate with devotees who are con­
sidered more advanced. 44) Live in the jurisdiction of Mathura.

How to Discharge Devotional Service

57

Now, the total regulative principles come to an aggregate of sixty­

four items. As we have mentioned, the first are the primary ten

regulative principles. Then come the secondary ten regulative princi­

ples, and added to these are forty-four other activities. So altogether
there are sixty-four items for discharging the regulative practice of

devotional service. Out of these sixty-four items, five items-namely,

offering water to the tulasi tree, hearing Srimad-Bhiigavatam, asso­

ciating amongst the devotees, smikirtana and living in Mathura-are

very important.

The sixty-four items of devotional service should include all of our

activities of body, mind and speech. As it was stated in the beginning,

the regulative principle of devotional service enjoins .that all of our

senses must be employed in the service of the Lord. Exactly how they
can be thus employed is described in the above sixty-four items. Now,

Snla Rilpa Gosvami will give evidences from different scriptures

supporting the authenticity of many of these points.

7 I Evidence
Regarding Devotional Principles

In the Eleventh Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, Prabuddha tells
Maharaj Nimi: "My dear King, please know for certain that in the
material world there is no happiness. It is simply a mistake to think
that there is happiness here, because this plac� is full of nothing but
miserable conditions. Any person who is seriously desirous of achiev­
ing real happiness must seek out a bona fide spiritual master and take
shelter of him by initiation. The qualification of a spiritual master is
that he must have realized the conclusion of the scriptures by delib­
eration and arguments and thus be able to convince others of these
conclusions. Such great personalities who have taken shelter of the
Supreme Godhead, leaving aside all material considerations, are to be
understood as bona fide spiritual masters. Everyone should try to
find such a bona fide spiritual master in order to fulfill his mission
of life, which is to transfer himself to the plane of spiritual bliss."
The purport is that one should not accept as a spiritual master
someone who is Fool Number One, who has no direction according
to the scriptural inj unctions, whose character is doubtful, who does
not follow the principles of devotional service, or who has not con­
quered the influence of the six sense gratifying agents. The six agents
of sense gratification are the tongue, the genitals, the belly, anger,
the mind and words. Anyone who has practiced controlling these six
is permitted to make disciples all over the world. To accept such a
spiritual master is the crucial point for advancement in spiritual life.
One who is fortunate enough to come under the shelter of a bona
fide spiritual master is sure to traverse the path of spiritual salvation
without any doubt.

To Accept Initiation from the Spiritual Master
and Receive Instructions from Him

Sage Prabuddha continued to speak to the King as follows: "My
dear King, a disciple has to accept the spiritual master not only as
spiritual master, but also as the representative of the Supreme Per­
sonality of Godhead and the supersoul. In other words, the disciple
should accept the spiritual master as God because he is the external
manifestation of Kr�tJ.a." This is confirmed in every scripture, and a
disciple should accept the spiritual master as such. One should learn

Srimad-Bhiigavatam seriously and with all respect and veneration for

the spiritual master. Hearing and speaking Srimad-Bhiigavatam is the
religious process which elevates one to the platform of serving and

loving the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
The attitude of the disciple should always be to satisfy the bona
fide spiritual master. Then it will be very easy for him to understand

spiritual knowledge. This is confirmed in the Vedas, and it will be
further explained by Riipa Gosvami that, for a person who has un­

flinching faith in God and the spiritual master, everything becomes
revealed very easily.

To Serve the Spiritual Master with Faith and Confidence

Regarding accepting initiation from the spiritual master, in the

Eleventh Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, 17th Chapter, 22nd verse, it
is stated by Lord Kr�tta: "My dear Uddhava, the spiritual master must
be accepted not only as My representative but as My very self. He
must never be considered on the same level with an ordinary human
being. One should never be envious of the spiritual master, as one
may be envious of an ordinary man. The spiritual master should al­
ways be seen as the representative of the Supreme Personality of God­
head, and by serving the spiritual master, one is able to serve all the
demigods."

60

The Nectar of Devotion

To Follow in the Footsteps of Saintly Persons
In the Skanda Puriirw it is advised that a devotee follow the past

iiciiryas and saintly persons because by such following one can achieve

the desired results, with no chance of lamenting or being baffled in

his progress.

In the scripture known as Brahma-yiimala it is stated as follows:

"If someone wants to pose himself as a great devotee without follow­

ing the authorities of the revealed scriptures, then his activities will

never help him to make progress in devotional service. Instead, he

will simply create disturbances for the sincere students of devotional

service." Those who do not strictly follow the principles of revealed

scriptures are generally called sahajiyii, those who have imagined

everything to be cheap, and who have their own concocted ideas, and
who do not follow the scriptural injunctions. Such persons are simply

creating disturbances in the discharge of devotional service.

In this connection, an objection may be raised by those who are

not in devotional service and who do not care for the revealed scrip­

tures. An example of this is seen in Buddhist philosophy. Lord

Buddha appeared in the family of a high-grade k�atriya king, but his

philosophy was not in accord with the Vedic conclusions and there­

fore was rejected. Under the patronage of a Hindu king, Maharaj

Asoka, the Buddhist religion was spread all over India and the adjoin­

ing countries. However, after the appearance of the great stalwart

teacher, Sa:rikaracarya, this Buddhism was driven out beyond the

border of India.

The Buddhists or other religionists who do not care for revealed

scriptures sometimes say that there are many devotees of Lord

Buddha who show devotional service to Lord Buddha and who there­

fore should be considered devotees. In answer to this argument, Riipa

Gosvami says that the followers of Buddha cannot be accepted as

devotees. Although Lord Buddha is accepted as an incarnation of

Kr�!!a, the followers of such incarnations are not very advanced in
their knowledge of the Vedas. To study the Vedas means to come to
the conclusion of the supremacy of the Personality of Godhead.

Therefore any religious principle which denies the supremacy of the

Evidence Regarding Devotional Principles

61

Personality of Godhead is not accepted and is called atheism. Atheism
means defying the authority of the Vedas and decrying the great

iiciiryas who teach Vedic scriptures for the benefit of the people in
general.
Lord Buddha is accepted as an incarnation of Kr��a in the Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, but in the same Srimad-Bhiigavatam it is stated that
Lord Buddha appeared in order to bewilder the atheist class of men.
Therefore his philosophy is meant for bewildering the atheists and
should not be accepted. If someone asks, "Why should Kr��a propa­
gate atheistic principles'(" the answer is that it was the desire of the
Supreme Personality of Godhead to end the violence which was then
being committed in the name of the Vedas. The so-called religionists
were falsely using the Vedas to justify such violent acts as meat­

eating, and Lord Buddha came to lead the fallen people away from
such a false interpretation of the Vedas. Also, for the atheist class,
Lord Buddha preached atheism so that they would follow him and
thus be tricked into devotional service to Lord Buddha, or Kr��a.

Inquiring about External Religious Principles

In the Niiradiya Puriirw it is said: "If one is actually very serious
about devotional service, then all of his purposes will be served with­
out any delay."

Residing in a Sacred Place

In the Padma Puriirw it is stated: "For one who has given up his
material sense enjoyment and has accepted the principles of devo­
tional service, the opulence of Vi��u-loka [the kingdom of God] is
awaiting." In the same Padma Puriir-a it is also said that for a person
who has lived in Dvaraka for six months, for one month, or even for
one fortnight, there is awaiting elevation to the Vaiku�tha-lokas and
all the profits of siiriipya-mukti (the privilege of having the same
four-handed bodily features as Naraya�a ).

62

The Nectar of Devotion

In the Brahma Purii[La it is said: "The transcendental significance

of Puru§ottama-k§etra, which is the 80-square-mile field of Lord

Jagannatha, cannot be properly described. Even the demigods from

higher planetary systems see the inhabitants of this Jagannatha Piiri
as having exactly the same features of body as are possessed by one

in V aiku�tha. That is, the demigods see the inhabitants of J agannatha
Piiri as being four-handed."

When there was a meeting of great sages at N aimi�ara�ya, Siita

Gosvami was reciting Srimad-Bhiigavatam, and the importance of the
Ganges was stated as follows: "The waters of the Gan ges are always
carrying the flavor of tulasi offered at the lotus feet of Sri Krwa, and

as such the waters of the Ganges are ever flo..wing, spreading the
glories of Lord Kr��a. Wherever the waters of the Ganges are flowing,
all will be sanctified, both externally and internally."

To Accept Only What is Necessary

In the Niiradiya Purii[La it is directed: "One should not accept
more than necessary if he is serious about discharging devotional ser­
vice." The purport is that one should not neglect following the prin­

ciples of devotional service, nor should one accept the rulings of
devotional service which are more than what he can easily perform.

For example, it may be said that one should chant the Hare K[§[La

mantra at least 100,000 times daily on his beads. But if this is not

possible, then one must minimize his chanting according to his own
capacity. Generally, we recommend our disciples to chant at least 16

rounds on their japa beads daily, and this should be completed. But

if one is not even able to chant 16 rounds, then he must make it up

the next day. He must be sure to keep his vow. If he does not strictly

follow this out, then he is sure to be negligent. That is offensive in
the service of the Lord. If we encourage offenses, we shall not be
able to make progress in devotional service. It is better if one fixes up
a regulative principle according to his own ability and then follows

that vow without fail. That will make him advanced in spiritual life.

Observing Fasting on Ekiidasi

In the Brahma-vaivarta Puriir;w it is said that one who observes
fasting on Ekiidasi day is freed from all kinds of reactions to sinful
activities and advances in pious life. The basic principle is not j ust to
fast, but to increase one's faith and love for Govinda, or Kr�!la. The
real reason for observing fasting on Ekiidasi is to minimize the de­
mands of the body and to engage our time in the service of the Lord
by chanting or performing similar service. The best thing to do on
fasting days is to remember the pastimes of Govinda and to hear His
holy name constantly.

To Offer Respect to the Banyan Trees

In the Skanda Puriir;ta it is directed that a devotee should offer
water to the tulasi plant and iimalaka trees. He should offer respect
to the cows and to the briihmar;tas and should serve the Vai§r;tavas by
offering them respectful obeisances and meditating upon them. All
of these processes will help the devotee to diminish the reactions to
his past sinful activities.

To Give Up the Company of Nondevotees

Lord Caitanya was once asked by one of His householder devotees
what the general behavior of a Vai§r-ava should be. In this connection,
Lord Caitanya replied that a Vai§r;tava should always give up the com­
'

pany of nondevotees. Then He explained that there are two kinds of
nondevotees: one class is against the supremacy of Kr�!\a, and an­
other class is too materialistic. In other words, those who are after
material enj oyment and those who are against the supremacy of the
Lord are called avai§r-ava, and their company should be strictly
avoided.
In the Kiityiiyana-samhitii it is stated that even if one is forced to
live within a cage of iron or in the midst of a blazing fire, he should

The Nectar of Devotion

64

accept this position rather than live with nondevotees who. are
through and through against the supremacy of the Lord. Similarly,

in Vi�[lu-rahasya, there is a statement to the effect that one should

prefer to embrace a snake, a tiger or an alligator rather than associate

with persons who are worshipers of various demigods and who are .

impelled by material desire.

In the scriptures it is instructed that one may worship a certain

demigod if he is desirous of achieving some material gain. For exam-

\

ple, one is advised to worship the sun god if he is desirous of getting ,_,.,;':
rid of a diseased condition. For a beautiful wife, one can worship

Uma, the wife of Lord Siva, and for advanced education ont< may

worship Sarasvati. Similarly, there is a list in tqe Srimad-Bhiigavatam
for worshipers of all demigods, according to different material de­

sires. But all of these worshipers, although they appear to be very

good devotees of the demigods, are still considered to be nondevo­
tees. They cannot be accepted as devotees.
The miiyiiviidis

(impersonalists) say that one can worship any

form of the Lord and that it doesn't matter because one reaches the

same destination anyway. But it is clearly stated in the Bhagavad-gi tii

that those who are worshipers of the demigods will ultimately reach
only the planets of those demigods, while those who are devotees of

the Lord Himself will be promoted to the Lord's abode, the kingdom

of God. So actually these persons who are worshipers of demigods
have been condemned in the Gitii. It is described that due to their
lusty desires

they have lost their intelligence, and therefore they

have taken to worshiping the different demigods. So in the Vi�[lU­

rahasya these demigod worshipers are forcefully condemned by the

statement that it is better to live with the most dangerous animals
than to associate with these persons.

Another stricture is that a person may have many disciples, but he

should not act in such a way that he will be obliged to any of them
for some particular action or some favor. And one should also not be

very enthusiastic about constructing new temples, nor should one be

enthusiastic about reading various types of books, save and except
the ones which lead to the advancement of devotional service. Prac-

Mahar
With

while
verse, N arada Mum,
various functions of the different orders in society, especially men­

tions rules for the sannyiisis-those persons who have renounced this

material world. One who has accepted the sannyiisa order of life is

forbidden to accept as a disciple anyone who is not fit. A sannyiisi

should first of all examine whether a prospective student is sincerely

seeking Kr��a consciousness. If he is not, he should not be accepted.
However, Lord Caitanya 's causeless mercy is such that He advised
all bona fide spiritual masters to speak about Kr��a consciousness
everywhere. Therefore, in the line of Lord Caitanya, even the san­

nyiisis can speak about Kr��a consciousness everywhere, and if some­
one is seriously inclined to become a disciple, the sannyiisi always
accepts him.

The one point is that without increasing the number of disciples,

there is no propagation of the cult of Kr��a consciousness. Therefore,

sometimes even at a risk, a sannyiisi in the line of Caitanya Maha­

prabhu may accept· even a person who is not thoroughly fit to be­

come a disciple. Later on, by the mercy of such a bona fide spiritual
master, the disciple is gradually elevated. However, if one increases

the number of disciples simply for some prestige or false honor, he
will surely fall down in the matter of executing Krwa consciousness.

Similarly, a bona fide spiritual master has no business to read

many books simply to show his proficiency or to get popularity by

lecturing in different places. One should avoid all these things. It is

also stated that a sannyiisi should not be enthusiastic about con­

structing tern ples. We can see in the life of various iiciiryas in the line

of Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu that they are not very enthusiastic about
constructing temples. However, if somebody comes forward to offer

some service, the same reluctant iiciiryas will encourage the building
of costly temples by such servitors. For example, Riipa Gosvami was

The Nectar of Devotion

66

offered a favor by Maha dij

Mansingh , the commander-in-chief of

Emperor Akbar, and Rupa Gosvami instructed him to construct a
large temple for Govindaj i, which cost vast amounts of money.

So a bona fide spiritual master should not personally take any re­

sponsibility for constructing temples, but if someone has money
and wants to spend it in the service of Kr��a, an iiciirya like Rupa
Gosvami may utilize the devotee's money to construct a nice costly
temple for the service of the Lord. Unfortunately, it happens that

someone who is not fit to become a spiritual master may approach
wealthy persons to contribute for temple constructions. If such
money is utilized by unqualified spiritual masters to live comfortably

in costly temples without actually doing any preaching work, this is

not acceptable. In other words, a spiritual master needn't be very
enthusiastic for constructing temple buildings simply in the name of

so-called spiritual advancement. Rather, his first and foremost activi­

ty should be to preach. In this connection, Snla Bhaktisiddhanta

Sarasvati Gosvami Maharaj recommended that a spiritual master print

books. If one has money, instead of constructing costly temples,

one should spend his money for the publication of authorized books
in different languages for propagating the Kr��a consciousness move­
ment.

Straightforwardness in Ordinary Dealings
There is a statement in the Padma Puriir-a: "Persons who are
engaged in Kr��1a consciousness should never be disturbed by some
material gain or loss. Even if there is some material loss, one should

not be perturbed, but should always think of Kr��a within Himself."

The purport is that every conditioned soul is always absorbed in

thinking of materialistic activities; he has to make himself freed from
such thoughts and transfer himself completely to Kr��1a conscious­

ness. As we have already explained, the basic principle of Kr��a con­
sciousness is to always think of Kr��a. One should not be disturbed
in material loss, but, rather, should concentrate his mind upon the

lotus feet of the Lord.

Evidence Regarding Devotional Principles

67

A devotee should not be subjected to lamentation or illusion.

There is the following statement in the Padma Purar-a: "Within the

heart of a person who is overpowered by lamentation or anger, there
is no possibility of Krwa being manifested."

The Demigods

One should not become neglectful to offer due respect to the

demigods. One may not be a devotee of demigods, but that does not

mean that he should be disrespectful to them. For example, a Vai§­

r-ava is not a devotee of Lord Siva or Lord Brahma, but he is duty­

bound to offer all respects to such highly-positioned demigods. Ac­

cording to Vai§r-ava philosophy, one should offer respect even to an

ant, so then what need is there to speak of such exalted persons like
Lord Siva and Lord Brahma?

In the Padma Purar-a it is said, "Krwa, or Hari, is the master of all

demigods, and therefore He is always worshipable. But this does not

mean that one should not offer respect to the demigods."

Not Giving Pain to Any Living Entity

This is the statement of Mahiibhiirata: "A person who does not

disturb or cause painful action in the mind of any living entity, who

treats everyone just like a loving father does his children, whose heart
is so pure, certainly very soon becomes favored by the Supreme Per­
sonality of Godhead."

In so-called civilized society there is sometimes agitation against

cruelty to animals, but at the same time regular slaughterhouses are
always maintained. A Vai§r-ava is not like that. A Vai§r-ava can never
support animal slaughter nor even give pain to any living entity.

8 I Offenses to be Avoided

In the supplementary Vedic literature, there is the following list of

32 offenses in the matter of serving the Lord: 1) One should not

enter the temple of the Deity in a car or palanq'uin or with shoes on

the feet. 2) One should not fail to observe the various festivals for
the pleasure of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, such as ./an­

mii§tami, Ratha-yiitrii, etc. 3) One should not avoid bowing down be­
fore the Deity. 4) One should not enter the temple to worship the
Lord without having washed his hands and feet after eating. 5) One

should not enter the temple in a contaminated state. (According to
Vedic scripture, if someone dies in the family the whole family be­

comes contaminated for some time, according to its status. For ex­

ample, if the family is briihma[La their contamination period is 12

days, for the k§atriyas and vaisyas it is 15 days, and fo� siidras 30

days.) 6) One should not bow down on one hand. 7) One should not

circumambulate in front of Sri Kr��a. (The process of circumam­

bulating the temple is that one should begin circumambulating from
the Deity's right-hand side of the temple and come round. Such cir­

cumambulation should be performed outside the temple structure at
least three times daily.) 8) One should not spread his legs before the
Deity. 9) One should not· sit before the Deity holding the ankles,
elbows or knees with his hands. 10) One should not lie down before
the Deity of Kr��a. 11) One should not accept prasiidam before the
Deity. 12) One should never speak a lie before the Deity. 13) One

should not talk very loudly before the Deity. 14) One should not
talk with others before the Deity. 15) One should not cry or howl
before the Deity.

16) One should not quarrel or fight before the
68

Offenses to be A voided

69

Deity. 17) One should not chastise anyone before the Deity. 18)
One should not be charitable to beggars before the Deity. 19) One
should not speak very harshly to others before the Deity. 20) One
should not wear a fur blanket before the Deity. 21) One should not
eulogize or praise anyone else before the Deity. 22) One should not
speak any ill names before the Deity. 23) One should not pass air be­
fore the Deity. 24) One should not fail to worship the Deity accord­
ing to his means. (In the Bhagavad-gitii it is stated that the Lord is
satisfied even if some devotee offers him a leaf or a little water. This
formula prescribed by the Lord is universally applicable, even for the
poorest man. But that does not mean that one who has sufficient
means to worship the Lord very nicely should also adopt this method
and try to satisfy the Lord simply by offering water and a leaf. If he
has sufficient means, he should offer nice decorations, nice flowers,
nice foodstuffs and observe all ceremonies. It is not that one should
try to satisfy the Supreme Lord with a little water and a leaf, and for
himself spend all his money in sense gratification.) 25) One should
not eat anything which is not offered first to Krwa. 26) One should
not fail to offer fresh fruit and grains to Krgta, according to the sea­
son. 27) After cooking, no one should be offered any foodstuff un­
less it is first offered to the Deity. 28) One should not sit with his
back towards the Deity. 29) One should not offer obeisances silently
to the spiritual master; or in other words, one should recite aloud the
prayers to the spiritual master while offering obeisances. 30) One
should not fail to offer some praise in the presence of the spiritual
master. 31) One should not praise himself before the spiritual master.
32) One should not deride the demigods before the Deity.
This is a list of 32 offenses. Besides these, there are a number of
offenses which are mentioned in the Variiha Puriir-a. They are as fol­
lows: 1) One should not touch the Deity in a dark room. 2) One
should not fail to strictly follow the rules and regulations in wor­
shiping the Deity. 3) One should not enter the temple of the Deity
without first making some sound. 4) One should not offer any food­
stuff to the Deity which has been seen by dogs or other lower ani­
mals. 5) One should not break the silence while worshiping. 6) One
should not pass urine or evacuate while engaged in worshiping. 7) One

70

The Nectar of Devotion

should not offer incense without offering some flower. 8) Useless

flowers without any fragrance should not be offered. 9) One should

not fail to wash his teeth very carefully every day. 10) One should

not enter the temple directly after sexual intercourse. 11) One should

not touch a woman during her menstrual period. 12) One should not

enter the temple after touching a dead body. 13) One should not en­

ter the temple wearing garments of red or blue color, or which are

unwashed. 14) One should not enter the temple after seeing a dead

body. 15) One should not pass air within the temple. 16) One should
not be angry within the temple. 17) One should not enter the temple
after visiting a crematorium. 18) One should not belch before the
Deity. So, until one has fully digested his food, he should not enter

the temple. 19) One should not smoke marijuana or gafija.

should not take opium or similar intoxicants.

20) One
21) 0 ne should not

enter the Deity room or touch the body of the Deity after having

smeared oil over his body. 22) One should not show disrespect to a
scripture teaching about the supremacy of the Lord. 23) One should

not introduce any opposing scripture. 24) One should not chew betel

before the Deity. 25) One should not offer a flower which was kept in

an unclean pot. 26) One should not worship the Lord while sitting on
the bare floor: one must have a sitting place or carpet. 27) One
should not touch the Deity before he has completed taking bath.
28) One should not decorate his forehead with the three-lined tilaka.

29) One should not enter the temple without washing his hands and

feet.

Other rules are that one should not offer foodstuff which is

cooked by a non- Vair!wva. One should not worship the Deity before

a nondevotee. One should not engage himself in the worship of the

Lord while seeing a nondevotee. One should begin the worship of the

demigod Ga�apati, who drives away all impediments in the execution
of devotional service. In the Brahma-sarhhitii it is stated that Ga�apati

worships the lotus feet of Lord Nrsimhadeva, and in that way he has
become auspicious for the devotees in clearing out all impediments.

Therefore, all devotees should worship Ga�apati. The Deities should
not be bathed in water which has been touched by the nails or fin­

gers. When a devotee is perspiring, he should not engage himself in

..

Offenses to be A voided

71

worshiping the Deity. Similarly, there are many other prohibitions,
such as one should not cross or step over the flowers offered to the

Deities, nor should one take a vow in the name of God. These are all

different kinds of offenses in the matter of executing devotional ser­
vice, and one should be careful to avoid them.

In the Padma Purii[la it is stated that even a person whose life is

completely sinful will be completely protected by the Lord if he sim­

ply surrenders unto Him. So it is accepted that one who surrenders
unto the Supreme Personality of Godhead becomes freed from all
sinful reactions. And even when a person becomes an offender unto

the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, he can still be delivered

simply by taking shelter of the holy names of the Lord: Hare K[§l)a,
Hare K[§l)a, Kr§fla K[§l)a, Hare Hare/ Hare Riima, Hare Riima, Riima
Riima, Hare Hare. In other words, the chanting of Hare Kr§fla is

beneficial for eradicating all sins; but if one becomes an offender to
the holy names of the Lord, then he has no chance of being delivered.
The offenses against the chanting of the holy name are as follows:

l) To blaspheme the devotees who have dedicated their lives for
propagating the holy name of the Lord. 2) To consider the names of

demigods like Lord Siva or Lord Brahma to be equal to, or indepen­

dent of, the name of Lord Vi�!lu. (Sometimes the atheistic class of

men take it that any demigod is as good as the Supreme Personality
of Godhead, Vi�!lu. But one who is a devotee knows that no demi­
god, however great ·he may be, is independently as good as the Su­
preme Personality of Godhead. Therefore if someone thinks that he

can chant Kiili,

Kiili! or Durgii, Durgii! and it is the same as Hare
K[§l)a, that is the greatest offense.) 3) To disobey the orders of the
spiritual master. 4) To blaspheme the Vedic literature or literature
in pursuance of the Vedic version. 5) To consider the glories of
chanting Hare K[§[la as imagination. 6) To give some interpretation
on the holy name of the Lord. 7) To commit sinful activities on the
strength of the holy name of the Lord. (Because by chanting the
holy name of the Lord one can be freed from all kinds of sinful re­

actions, it should not be taken that one may continue to act sinfully
and after that chant Hare Kr§fla to neutralize his sins. Such a danger­

ous mentality is very offensive and should be avoided. 8) To consider

72

The Nectar of Devotion

the chanting of Hare Kr§"!W as one of the auspicious ritualistic activi­
ties which are offered in the Vedas as fruitive activities (karma­

kiir-�a). 9) To instruct a faithless person about the glories of the holy
name. (Anyone can take part in chanting the holy name of the Lord,
but in the beginning one should not be instructed about the transcen­
dental potency of the Lord. Those who are too sinful cannot ap­
preciate the transcendental glories of the Lord, and therefore it is
better not to instruct them in this matter.) 10) To not have complete
faith in the chanting of the holy names and to maintain material at­
tachments, even after understanding so many instructions on this
matter.
Every devotee who claims to be a Vai§r-ava must guard against
these offenses in order to quickly achieve the desired success.

9 I Further Consideration
of Devotional Principles

Blasphemy
One should not tolerate blaspheming of the Lord or His devotees.

In this connection, in the Tenth Canto, 70th Chapter, 25th verse, of
Srimad-Bhiigavatam, Sukadeva Gosvami tells Parik�it Maharaj: "My

dear King, if a person, after hearing blasphemous propaganda against

the Lord and His devotees, does not go away from that place, he
becomes bereft of the effect of all pious activities."

In one of Lord Caitanya's Sik§ii§!aka verses it is stated: "The

devotee should be more tolerant than the tree and more submissive
than the grass. He should offer all honor to others, but may not

accept any honor for himself." In spite of Lord Caitanya's being so

humble and meek a.s a devotee, when He was informed about injuries

inflicted on the body of Sri Nityananda, He immediately ran to the
spot and wanted to kill the offenders, J agai and Madhai. This behav­

ior of Lord Caitanya is very significant. It shows that a Vai§[WVa may

be very tolerant and meek, foregoing everything for his personal
honor, but when it is a question of the honor of Kr�tta or His devotee,

he will not tolerate any insult.

There are three ways of dealing with such insults. If someone is

heard blaspheming by words, one should be so expert that he can

defeat the opposing party by argument. If he is unable to defeat the

opposing party, then the next step is that he should not just stand

there meekly, but should give up his life. The third process is followed
if he is unable to execute the above-mentioned two processes, and

this is that one must leave the place and go away. If a devotee does
73

The Nectar of Devotion

74

not do any of the above-mentioned three processes, he falls down
from his position of devotion.

Tilaka, Tulasi Beads and Flower Garlands
In the Padma Puriirw there is a statement describing how a

Vai§"[WVa should decorate his body with tilaka and beads: "Persons

who put tulasi beads on the neck, who mark twelve places of

their body as Vi��u temples with Vi��u's symbolic representations
[the four items held in the four hands of Lord Vi��u-conch, mace,
disk and lotus] , and who have Vi��u tilaka on their forehead, are to
be understood as the devotees of Lord Vi��u in this world. Their
presence makes the world purified, and anywhere they remain they
make that place as good as V aiku�tha."

A similar statement is in the Skanda Purii[La, which says: "Per­

sons who are decorated with tilaka or gopi-candana [a kind of clay
resembling fuller's earth which is produced in certain quarters of
V rndavana ], and who mark their bodies all over with the holy names

of the Lord, and on whose neck and breast there are tulasi beads, are

never approached by the Yama-diitas." The Yama-diitas are the con­

stables of King Yama (the Lord of death), who punishes all sinful
men. Vai§[Lavas are never called for by such constables of Yamaraj.

In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, in the narration of Ajamila's deliverance,

it is said that Yamaraj gave clear instructions to his assistants not to

approach the Vai§[Lavas. Vai§[Lavas are beyond the jurisdiction of
I

�I
I

·I

Yamaraj's activities.

In the Padma Puriira it is also mentioned: "A person whose body

is decorated with the pulp of sandalwood, with paintings of the
holy name of the Lord, is delivered from all sinful reactions, and after
his death he goes directly to Kr��a-loka to live in association with the
Supreme Personality of Godhead."
The next instruction is that one should put on flower garlands
which are offered to the Deity. In this connection, in the Eleventh

Canto, 6th Chapter, 31st verse, of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, Uddhava says

to Kr��a, "My dear Kr��a, I have taken things which You have used

Further Consideration of Devotional Principles

75

and enjoyed, such as garlands of flowers, saintly articles, garments
and ornaments, and I eat only the remnants of Your foodstuff be­
cause I am Your menial servant. So, therefore, I am sure that I shall
not be attacked by the spell of material energy." The purport of this
verse is that for any person who simply follows these rules and regu­
lations of decorating the body with the marks of tilaka of gopi­
candana or sandalwood pulp, and who puts on the garlands which
were offered to Kr��a, there is no question of being conquered by
the spell of material energy. At the time of death, there is no question
of such a person being called by the constables of Yamaraj. Even if
one does not accept all the Vai§r.ava principles, but still takes the
remnants of foodstuff offered to Krwa, or Kr§r-a-prasiidam, he will
gradually become qualified to rise to the platform of a Vai§r.ava.
Similarly, in the Skanda Puriir-a Lord Brahma tells Narada: "My
dear Narada, anyone who puts on his neck the flower garland which
was formerly used by Kr��a becomes relieved from all disease and
reactions to sinful activities, and gradually he gets liberated from the
contamination of matter."

Dancing before the Deity
In the Dviirahii-miihiitmya the importance of dancing before the
Deity is stated by Lord Kr��a as follows: "A person who is in a jubi­
lant spirit, who feels profound devotional ecstasy while dancing be­
fore Me, and who manifests different features of bodily expression,
can burn away all the accumulated sinful reactions he has stocked up
for many, many thousands of years." In the same book there is a
statement by Narada wherein he asserts: "From the body of any
person who claps and dances before the Deity, showing manifesta­
tions of ecstasy, all the birds of sinful activities fly away upwards."
Just as by clapping the hands one can cause many birds to fly away,
similarly the birds of all sinful activities which are sitting on the body
can be made to fly away simply by dancing and clapping before the
Deity of Kr��a.

76

The Nectar of Devotion

Bowing Down and Standing Up in Honor of the Deity

In the Niiradiya Puriirw there is a statement about bowing down
and offering respect to the Deity. It is said there: "A person who has
performed a great ritualistic sacrifice and a person who has simply
offered his respectful obeisances by bowing down before the Lord
cannot be held as equals." The person who has executed many great
sacrifices will attain the result of his pious activities, but when such
results are finished, he has to take birth again on the earthly planet;
whereas the person who has once offered respect�, bowing down be­
fore the Deity, will not again come back to this world, because he
will go directly to the abode of Kr��a.
In the Brahmii1y}a Puriirw it is said: "A person who sees the Lord's
Ratha-yiitrii car festival and then stands up to receive the Lord can

purge all kinds of sinful results from his body." A similar statement
is there in the Bhavi§ya Puriirw, in which it is said: "A person who
follows the Ratha-yiitrii car when the Rathas [Deities] pass in front
or from behind, even if born of a lowly family, will surely be elevated
to the position of achieving equal opulence with Viwu."

Going to the Temple of Vi§rtU or to Places of Pilgrimage

It is stated in the Puriirtas: "Persons who attempt to visit the
holy places of pilgrimage, like Vrndavana, Mathura or Dvaraka, are
actually glorified. By such traveling activities, they can pass over the
desert of material existence."
In the Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya, there is a statement about the bene­
fit of visiting the temples of Lord Krwa. As we have explained pre­
viously, in Vrndavana, Mathura and Dvaraka the system is that all the
devotees take advantage of visiting various temples situated in those
holy places. It is stated in the Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya: "Persons who
are impelled by pure devotional service in Kr��a consciousness and
who therefore go to see the Deities of Vi��u in the temple will surely
get relief from entering again into the prison house of a mother's
womb." The conditioned soul forgets the trouble of living within the

�:

I

.':

Further Consideration of Devotional Principles

77

mother's womb during birth, but it is a very painful and terrible ex­
perience. In order to make an escape from this material condition,
one is advised to visit a temple of Vi�!J.U with devotional conscious­
ness. Then one can very easily get out of the miserable condition of
material birth.

Circumambulating the Temple of Vi§[lU
It is said in the Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya: "A person who is circum­
ambulating the Deity of Viwu can counteract the circumambulation
of repeated birth and death in this material world." The conditioned
soul is circumambulating through repeated births and deaths on ac­
count of his material existence, and this can be counteracted simply
by circumambulating the Deity in the temple.

The Caturmasya ceremony is observed during the four months of

the rainy season in India, be ginning from Sravar-a (approximately
July, August, September and October). During these four months,
saintly persons who are accustomed to travel from one place to an­
other to propagate Kr�!la consciousness remain at one place, usually
a holy place of pilgrimage. During these times, there are certain spe­
cial rules and regulations which are strictly followed. It is stated in
the Skanda Purar-a that during this period, if someone circumambu­

lates the temple of Vi�!J.U at least four times, it is understood that he
has traveled all over the universe. By such circumambulation, one is
understood to have seen all the holy places where the Ganges water is

flowing, and by following the regulative principles of Caturmasya one
can very quickly be raised to the platform of devotional service.

Arcana
Arcana means to worship the Deity in the temple. By executing
this process one confirms himself as not body but spirit soul. In the
Tenth Canto, 8lst Chapter, 16th verse, of the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, it

is told how Sudama, an intimate friend of Kr�!J.a, while going to the

78

The Nectar of Devotion

house of a briihma[la murmured to himself, "Simply by worshiping
Kr9pa one can easily achieve all the results of heavenly opulence, lib­

eration, supremacy over the planetary systems of the universe, all the
opulences of this material world, and the mystic power of performing

the yoga system."

The events leading to Sudama's murmuring this statement are as

follows: Sri Kr�pa had ordered His friend Sudama to go to a briih­

ma[la's house and ask for some food. The briihma[laS were performing

a great sacrifice, and Sri Krwa told Sudama to plead with them
that He and Balarama were feeling hungry and needed some food.

When Sudama went there, the briihma[las refused to offer anything,

but the wives of the briihma[laS, upon hearing that Sri Kr9pa wanted

some foodstuff, immediately took many palatable dishes and went to

offer them to Sri Kr�pa. In the Vi§[lU-rahasya also, it is stated: "Any

person within this world who is engaged in the worship of Vi�pu can
very easily achieve the ever-blissful kingdom of God, known as
Vaikuptha."

Rendering Service to the Lord

It is stated in the Vi§"[lU-rahasya: "Any person who can arrange for

service to the Lord in the same way that a king is given service by his
attendants is surely elevated to the abode of Kr9pa after death."

Actually, in India, the temples are just like royal palaces. They are
not ordinary buildings because the worship of Kr9pa should be per­

formed in just the way that a king is worshiped in his palace. So in
Vrndavana there are many hundreds of temples wherein the Deity is

worshiped exactly like a king. In the Niiradiya Purii[la it is stated:

"If a person stays in the Lord's temple even for a few moments, he

can surely achieve the transcendental kingdom of God."

The conclusion is that those who are rich men in society should

construct beautiful temples and arrange for the worship of Vi9pu, so

that people may be attracted to visit such temples and thereby be

offered the opportunity of dancing before the Lord, or chanting the

Further Consideration of Devotional Principles

79

holy name of the Lord, or else of hearing the holy name of the Lord.
In this way, everyone will be given the chance to elevate himself to
the kingdom of God. In other words, even a common man, simply by
visiting such a temple, will be able to attain the highest benedictions,
not to mention the devotees who are constantly engaged in the ser­
vice of the Lord in full Kr�rta consciousness.
In this connection, there is a statement in the Fourth Canto of the

Srimad-Bhiigavatam, wherein King J>rthu says to his subjects: "My
dear citizens, please note that the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Hari, is actually the deliverer of all fallen conditioned souls. No demi­
god can perform this act of delivering the conditioned souls, because
the demigods themselves are conditioned. A conditioned soul cannot
deliver another conditioned soul. Only Krwa or His bona fide repre­
sentative can deliver him. The Ganges water which is flowing down

from the toe of Lord Vi�rtu falls upon the earthly planet and other
planets and thereby delivers all the conditioned sinful living entities.
So what need is there to speak of the deliverance of persons who are
always engaged in the service of the Lord? There is no doubt about
their liberation, even if they have stocks of sinful activities from
many, many births." In other words, a person who is engaged in the
worship of the Deities can minimize his stock of sinful reactions com­
ing from many, many previous births. This process of worshiping the
Deity has already been described, and one should try to follow these
rules and regulations seriously.

In the Linga Puriira there is a statement about glorifying and sing­

ing about the Lord. It is said there: "A briihmara who is constantly
engaged in singing the glories of the Lord is surely elevated to the
same planet as the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Lord Kr�rta ap­
preciates this singing even more than the prayers offered by Lord
c;.

;,Iva.

"

When a person loudly chants the glories of the Lord's activities,
qualities, form, etc., it is called sankirtana. Sankirtana also refers to
the congregational chanting of the holy name of the Lord.

In the Vi§ru-dharma there is a statement glorifying this process of

congregational chanting: "My dear King, this word 'Kr�rta' is so aus­
picious that anyone who chants this holy name immediately gets rid

The Nectar of Devotion

80

of the resultant actions of sinful activities from many, many births."
That

is a

fact.

There

is

the

following statement in

Caitanya­

Caritamrta: "A person who chants the holy name of Kr��a once can

counteract the resultant actions of more sinful activities than he is
able to perform." A sinful man can perform many, many sinful activi­
ties, but he is unable to perform so many that they cannot be
wiped out by one single uttering of "Kr��a."
In the

Seventh

Canto,

9th

Chapter,

17th verse, of Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, Maharaj Prahlada offers the following prayers to the
Lord: "My dear Lord Nrsimha, if I can be elevated to the position of
Your servant, then it will be possible for me to hear about Your ac­
tivities. You are the supreme friend, the suprerpe worshipable Deity.
Your pastimes are transcendental, and simply by hearing of them one
can counteract all his sinful activities. Therefore, I shall not care for
all those sinful activities because simply by hearing about Your pas­
times I shall get out of all the contamination of material attach­
ment."
There are many songs about the Lord's activities. For example,
there

is

the

Brahma-samhitii,

sung

by

Lord Brahma, Niirada­

paficariitra, sung by Narada Muni, and Srimad-Bhiigavatam, sung by

S ukadeva Gosvami. If these songs are heard by any person, he can
easily get out of the clutches of material contamination. There should
be no difficulty in hearing these songs of God. They are coming
down from many, many millions of years ago, and people are still
taking advantage of them. So why, at this time, should one not take
full advantage and thus become liberated?

Glorifying the Lord's Transcendental Activities
In the First Canto, 5th Chapter,

22nd verse, of the Srimad-

. Bhiigavatam, Narada Muni tells his disciple, Vyasadeva, "My dear
Vyasa, you should know that persons who are engaged in executing
austerities and penances, studying the

Vedas, performing big sacri­

fices, chanting the hymns of the Vedas, speculating on transcendental

knowledge and performing charitable functions have for all their

Further Consideration of Devotional Principles

81

auspicious activities simply to gain a place in the association of devo­
tees and to chant the glories of the Lord." It is indicated here that
chanting and glorifying the Lord is the ultimate activity of the living
entity.

]apa
When a mantra or hymn is chanted softly and slowly, that is called

japa. The same mantra, when chanted loudly, is called kirtana. For
example, the mahii-mantra (Hare K[§[W, Hare K[§[la, K[§[la K[§[la,

Hare Hare/ Hare Riima, Hare Riima, Riima Riima, Hare Hare) when
uttered very softly only for one's own hearing is called japa. The
same mantra, when chanted loudly for being heard by all others, is
called kirtana. The mahii-mantra can be used for japa and kirtana also.
When japa is practiced it is for the personal benefit of the chanter,
but when kirtana is performed it is for the benefit of all others who
may hear.
In the Padma Purii[la there is a statement: "For any person who is
chanting the holy name either softly or loudly, the paths to liberation
and even heavenly happiness are at once open."

Submission
In the Skanda Purii[la there is a statement about submission unto
the lotus feet of the Lord. It is said there that those who are sober
devotees can offer their submission to Kr��a in the following three
ways:

l)

sampriithaniitmikii,� very

feelingly

dainyavodhikii, humbly submitting oneself;

offering prayers;

2)

3) liilasiimayi, desiring

some perfectional stage. This desiring some perfectional stage in
spiritual life is not sense gratification. When one realizes something
of his constitutional relationship with the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, he understands his original position and wants to be re­
instated in this position, either as friend, servant, parent or conjugal
lover of Kr��a. That is called liilasiimayi, or very eagerly desiring to

I

82

The Nectar of Devotion

go to one's natural position. This liilasamayi stage of submission
comes in the stage of perfect liberation, which is technically called
svariipa-siddhi, when the living entity understands, by perfect spiri­
tual advancement and revelation, his original relationship with the
Lord.

Submission in Feeling
In the Skanda Purar-a there is a statement by devotees praying to
the Lord: "My Lord, I know that young girls have natural affection
for young boys, and that young boys have .natural affection for
young girls. I am praying at Your lotus feet that my mind may be­
come attracted unto You in the same spontaneous way." The exam­
ple is very appropriate. When a young boy or girl sees a member of
the opposite sex there is a natural attraction, without the need for
any introduction. Without any training there is a natural attraction
due to the sex impulse. This is a material example, but the devotee is
praying that he may develop a similar spontaneous attachment for
the Supreme Lord, free from any desire for profit and without any
other cause. This natural attraction for the Lord is the perfectional
stage of self realization.
In the same Skanda Purar-a there is a statement about submission
and humbleness. It is stated there: "My dear Lord, there is no sinful
living entity who is more of a sinner than myself. Nor is there a
greater offender than myself. I am so greatly sinful and offensive that
when I come to confess my sinful activities before You, I am
ashamed." This is a natural position for a devotee. As far as the con­
ditioned soul is concerned, there is no wonder that he has some sin­
ful activities in his past life, and this should be admitted and con­
fessed before the Lord. As soon as this is done the Lord excuses the
sincere devotee. But that does not mean that one should take advan­
tage of the Lord's causeless mercy and expect to be excused over and
over again, while he commits the same sinful activities. Such a men­
tality is only for shameless persons. Here it is clearly said, "When I
come to confess my sinful activities I become ashamed." So if a per-

Further Consideration of Devotional Principles

83

son is not ashamed of his sinful activities and continues to commit
the same sinful activities with the knowledge that the Lord will ex­

cuse him, that is a most nonsensical proposition. Such an idea is not

accepted in any part of the Vedic literature. It is a fact that by

chanting the holy name of the Lord one becomes washed clean of

all sinful activities from his past life. But that does not mean that
after being washed off, one should again begin sinful activities and

expect to be washed again. These are nonsensical propositions and

are not admitted in the devotional service. Someone may think: "For

a whole week I may commit sinful activities, and for one day I will go

to the temple or church and admit my sinful activities so that I can

become washed off and again begin my sinning." This is most non­

sensical and offensive and is not acceptable to the author of Bhakti­

rasiimrta-sindhu.

In the Niirada-paiicariitra there is a statement of submission ac­

companied by the desire for perfection. The devotee says, "My dear

Lord, when shall that day come when You will ask me to fan Your

body, and according to Your pleasure, You will say, 'You just fan Me

in this way'?" The idea in this verse is that the devotee is desiring to
personally fan the body of the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

That means that he is desiring to become the personal associate of

the Supreme Lord. Of course, any devotee in any capacity, either as

servant, friend or c<;>njugal lover, always has direct association with

the Lord. But according to his different individual taste, a person de­

sires for just one of these relationships. Here the devotee is desiring

to become a servant of the Lord and desires to fan the Lord, as does
His internal energy, Lak�mi, the goddess of fortune. He also wishes

that the Personality of Godhead will be pleased to give him direc­

tions as to how to fan. This submission with transcendental desire, or

liilasiimayi vijiiapti, is the highest perfectional stage of spiritual reali­
zation.

In the same Niirada-paiicariitra, there is another expression of sub­

mission, wherein the devotee says, "My dear Lord, 0 lotus-eyed one,

when will that day come when on the bank of the Yamuna, I shall

become just like a madman and continue to chant Your holy name
while incessant tears flow from my eyes?" This is another perfec-

The Nectar of Devotion

84

tional stage. Lord Caitanya also desired that "a moment will appear
unto Me as twelve years of time, and the whole world will appear to

Me as vacant on account of not seeing You, My dear Lord." One
should feelingly pray artd bel;:ome eager to render his particular type

of service to the Lord�· THis Is the teaching of all great devotees, espe­

cially Lord Caitanya.

,.

In other words, one should learn how to cry for the Lord. One

should learn this smafl technique, and he should be very eager and

actually cry to become engaged in some particular type of service.

This is called laulyam, and such tears are the price for the highest

perfection. If one develops this laulyam, or excessive eagerness for

meeting and serving the Lord in a particular way, that is the price to
enter into the kingdom of God. Otherwise, there is no material calcu­

lation for the value of the ticket by which one can enter the kingdom

of God. The only price for such entrance is this laulyam liilasiimay�
or desire and great eagerness.

Prayers
According to great learned scholars, the whole Bhagavad-gitii con­

tains many authorized prayers, especially in the Eleventh Chapter,

where Arjuna prays to the universal form of the Lord. Similarly, in

the Gautamiya Tantra all the verses are called prayers. Again in the

Srimad-Bhiigavatam, there are hundreds of prayers to the Lord. So a

devotee should select some of these prayers for his recitation. In the

Skanda Purii[la the glories of these prayers are stated as follows:

"Devotees whose tongues are decorated always with prayers to Lord

Kr�!la are always given respect even by the great saintly persons and
sages, and such devotees are actually worshipable by the demigods."

Those who are less intelligent want to worship different demigods

for some material gain rather than worship Kr�!la. But here it is stated

that a devotee who is always engaged in offering prayers to the Lord

is worshipable even by the demigods themselves. The pure devotees
have nothing to ask from any demigod, but rather the demigods are

anxious to offer prayers to the pure devotees.

r

lL

Further Consideration of Devotional Principles

85

In the Nrsirhha Puriirw it is stated: "Any person who comes before
the Deity of Lord Krwa and begins to chant different prayers is
immediately relieved from all the reactions of sinful activities and be­
comes eligible, without any doubt, to enter into the Vaiku�tha-loka."

Partaking of Prasiidam
There is this specific statement in the Padma Puriirw: "A person
who honors the prasiidam and regularly eats it, not exactly in front
of the Deity, along with carartiimrtam [the water offered to the lotus
feet of the Lord, which is mixed with seeds of the tulasi tree], im­
mediately can achieve the results of pious activities which are ob­
tained through ten thousand performances of sacrificial rites."
Carartiimrtam is obtained in the morning while the Lord is being
washed before dressing. Scented with perfumes and flowers, the
water comes gliding down through His lotus feet and is collected and
mixed with yogurt. In this way this carartiimrtam not only becomes
very tastefully flavored, but it also has tremendous spiritual value. It
is described in the Padma Puriirta that even a person who has never
been able to give in charity, who has never been able to perform a
great sacrifice, who has never been able to study the Vedas, who has
never been able to �orship the Lord-or, in other words, even one
who has never done any pious activities-if he simply drinks the
carartiimrtam which is kept in the temple, he will become eligible to
enter into the kingdom of God. In the temple it is the custom that
the carartiimrtam be kept in a big pot. The devotees who come to visit
and offer respects to the Deity very submissively take three drops of
carartiimrtam and feel themselves happy in transcendental bliss.

Smelling the Incense
, In the Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya there is a statement about the in­
cense which is offered in the temple: "When the devotees smell the
good flavor of the incense which is offered to the Deity, they thus

The Nectar of Devotion

86

become cured of the poisonous effects of material contamination, as
much as one becomes cured of a snake bite by smelling the prescribed
medicinal herbs." The explanation of this verse is that there is an
herb which is found in the j ungles which expert persons know how
to use to revive the consciousness of one who is bitten by a snake.
Simply by smelling that herb one becomes immediately relieved of
the poisonous effects of the snake bite. The same example is appli­
cable: when a person comes to visit the temple and smells the in­
cense offered to the Deity, he is cured at that time from all his ma­
terial contamination.
Any devotee coming into the temple should always offer some­
thing to the Deity-fruit, flowers, incense, etc. If one cannot offer
anything in cash, something else must be offered. In India the system

is that all the ladies and gentlemen who come in the morning to

visit the temple bring so many things. Even one morsel of rice or one
morsel of flour can be offered. It is a regulative principle that one
should not go to see a saintly person or the Deity in the temple
without any offering. The offering may be very hum
' ble, or it may be
priceless. Even a flower, a little fruit, a little water-whatever is pos­
sible-must be offered. So when a devotee comes to offer something
to the Deity in the morning, he is sure to smell the good flavor of the
incense, and then at once he will become cleansed of the poisonous
effect of material existence.

It is stated in the Tantra-siistra: "If the smell of the garland which

was offered to the Deity in the temple enters into the nostril of a
person, immediately his bondage to sinful activities becomes cleared.
And even if one has no sinful activities, still, by smelling such rem­

nants of flowers, one can advance from miiyiiviidi (impersonalist) to
devotee." There are several instances of this, a prime one being the
advancement of the four Kumaras. They were impersonalist miiyiiviidis,

but after smelling the remnants of flowers and incense in the temple,
they turned to become devotees. From the above verse it appears

that the miiyiiviidis or impersonalists are more or less contaminated.
They are not pure.

It is confirmed in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam: "One who has not
washed off all reactions of sinful activities cannot be a pure devotee.

Further Consideration of Devotional Principles

A pure devotee has no more doubts about the supremacy of the Per­

sonality of Godhead, and thus he engages himself in Kr��a conscious­

ness and �evotional service." A similar statement is in the Agastya­

sarhhitii: Just to purify the impurities of our nostrils, we should try
to smell the remnants of flowers offered to Kr��a in the temple.

Touching the Deity
In the Vi§[tu-dharmottara there is a statement about touching the

lotus feet of the Lord. It is said: "Only a person who is initiated as a
Vai§r-ava and is executing devotional service in Kr��a consciousness

has the right to touch the body of the Deity." In India there was

agitation during Gandhi's political movement because the lowborn

classes of men like street-sweepers and car-fliilas are prohibited, ac­

cording to the Vedic system, from entering the temple. Due to their

unclean habits they are prohibited, but at the same time they are
given other facilities so they may be elevated to the highest grade of

devotional service by association with pure devotees. A man born in
any family is not barred, but he must be cleansed. That cleansing pro­

cess must be adopted. Gandhi wanted to make them clean simply by
stamping them with a fictitious name, Hari-jana (children of God),

and so there was a great tug of war between the temple owners and
Gandhi's followers.

But anyway, the present law is the law of all scripture-that if

anyone is purified he can enter into the temple. Actually, that is the

position. Only one who is properly initiated, who is properly follow­

ing the rules and regulations, can enter and touch the Deity-not all.
And one who touches the body of the Deity, following such regula­

tive principles, is immediately delivered from the contamination of

material sins, and all of his desires become fulfilled without delay.

In the Variiha Puriir-a, also, there is a statement praising the touching

of the D�ity of Sri Kr��a in the temple. A devotee says there: "My dear
Vasundharii, any person who goes to Vrndavana and sees the Deity of

Govindadeva is free from the courthouse of Y amaraj and is allowed

to enter into the highest planetary system, in which reside the demi-

The Nectar of Devotion

88
gods."

This means that even an ordinary person who goes to

Vrndavana out of inquisitiveness and by chance sees the temple,
especially that of Govindadeva, even if he is not elevated to the
spiritual kingdom, is still assured promotion to the higher plane­
tary systems. This means that simply by visiting the Deity of Govinda
in Vrndavana one becomes highly elevated in pious life.

Observing Ariitrika and Celebrations of the Lord
In the Skanda Puriir;w there is the following description of the re­
sult of seeing iiriitrika (worship) of the Deity: "If someone sees the
face of the Lord while iiriitrika is going on, he can be relieved of all
sinful reactions coming from many, many thousands and millions of
years past. He is even excused from the killing of a briihmar;w or simi­
lar prohibited activities."
As we have already explained, there are different ceremonies to be
observed, such as the birthday of Kr��a, the birthday of Lord Rama­
candra, the birthday of some prominent Vai§r:tavas, the ceremony of

]hulan-yiitrii with the Lord sitting on a swing, Dola-yiitrii (the Lord's
activities in the month of March), and so on. In all festivals the Lord
is seated on the car, and the car moves through different streets of
the city so that people may take advantage of visiting the Lord. In the

Bhavi�ya Puriir;w it is said: "In such a ceremony, if even a car;tf/iila
[dog-eater], simply out of curiosity, sees the Lord on the cart, he
becomes counted as one of the associates of Viwu."
In the Garufla furiir;w it is stated: "Any person who in gladness
sees the worship of the Deity in the temple will obtain the results of

kriyii-yoga which are described in the Paiicariitra scripture." Kriyii­
yoga is a system of practice much like practical devotional service,
but it is especially m�ant for the mystic yogis. In other words, by
this gradual process, the mystic yogis are eventually elevated to the
devotional service of the Lord.

10 I Techniques of Hearing
and Memorizing
The beginning of Kr9�a consciousness and devotional service is
hearing, in Sanskrit called .�ravar-am. All people should be given the
chance to come and join devotional parties so that they may hear.
This hearing is very important for progressing in Kr9va consciousness.
When one links his ears to give aural reception to the transcendental
vibrations he can quickly become purified and cleansed in the heart.
Lord Caitanya has affirmed that this hearing is very important. It
cleanses the heart of the contaminated soul so that he becomes quick­
ly qualified to enter into devotional service and to understand Kr9�a
consciOusness.
In the Garufla Puriil)a the stress on hearing is expressed very nicely.
It is said there: "The state of conditioned life in the material world
is just like a man lying unconscious, having been bitten by a snake.
This is because bo�h such unconscious states can be ended by the
sound of a mantra." When a man is snake-bitten he does not die
immediately, but first becomes unconscious and remains in a coma­
tose condition. Anyone who is in the material world is also sleeping,
as he is ignorant of his actual self or his actual duty and his rela­
tionship with God. So materialistic life means that one is bitten
by the snake of miiyii, illusion, and thus, without any Kr9!la con­
sciousness, he is almost dead. Now the so-called dead man bitten by
a snake can be brought back again to life by the chanting of some
mantra. There are expert chanters of these mantras who can perform

this feat. Similarly, one can be brought back into Kr9!la conscious­
ness from the deadly unconscious state of material life by hearing of
the mahii-mantra: Hare K[§fla, Hare K[§fla, K[§fla K[§fla, Hare Hare/
Hare Riima, Hare Riima, Riima Riima, Hare Hare.

The Nectar of Devotion
In the Fourth Canto of Srimad-Bhii.gavatam, 29th Chapter, 37th

verse, the importance of hearing of the pastimes of the Lord is stated

by Sukadeva Gosvami to Maharaj Parik�it: "My dear King, one
II

should stay at a place where the great acaryas [holy teachers] speak

about the transcendental activities of the Lord, and one should give

aural reception to the nectarean river flowing from the moonlike

faces of such great personalities. If someone eagerly continues to hear

such transcendental sounds, then certainly he will become freed from

all material hunger, thirst, fear and lamentation, as well as all illu­
sions of material existence."

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu also recommended this process of hear­

ing as a means of self realization in the present.age ofKali. In this age

it is very difficult to follow thoroughly the regulative principles and
studies of the Vedas which were formerly recommended. However, if

one gives aural reception to the sound vibrated by great devotees and

acaryas, that alone will give him relief from all material contamina­

tion. Therefore it is the recommendation of Caitanya Mahaprabhu

that one should simply hear from authorities who are actually devo­

tees of the Lord. Hearing from professional men will not help. If we

hear from those who are actually self realized, then the nectarean
rivers, like those which are flowing on the moon planet, will flow into

our ears. This is the metaphor used in the above verse.

As is stated in the Bhagavad-gita, "A materialistic person can give

up his material hankerings only by becoming situated in Kr�!la con­
sciousness." Unless one finds a superior engagement he will not be
able to give up his inferior engagement. In the material world every­

one is engaged in the illusory activities of inferior energy, but when
one is given the opportunity rt'\!�lish the activities of the superior

energy performed by Kr�!la, then he forgets all his lesser pleasures.

When Kr�!la speaks on the battlefield of Kuruk�etra, to the material­
istic person it appears that this is simply talk between two friends,

but actually it is a river of nectar flowing down from the mouth of
Sri Kr�!la. Arjuna gave aural reception to such vibrations, and thus

he became freed from all the illusions of material problems.

Techniques of Hearing and Memorizing

91

In the Twelfth Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, 3rd Chapter, 12th
verse, it is stated: "A person who desires unalloyed devotional ser­
vice to Lord Kf�l).a, who is praised by transcendental sound vibra­
tions, should always hear about His glorification and transcendental
qualities. This will surely kill all kinds of inauspiciousness in the
heart."
Also, in the Tenth Canto, 14th Chapter, 8th verse, it is said: "My
dear Lord, any person who is constantly awaiting Your causeless
mercy to be bestowed upon him, and who goes on suffering the re·
sultant actions of his past misdeeds, offering You respectful obei­
sances from the core of his heart, is surely eligible to become lib­
erated, for it has become his rightful claim."

This statement of Srimad-Bhiigavatam should be the guide of all

devotees. A devotee should not expect immediate relief from the re·
actions of his past misdeeds. No conditioned soul is free from such
reactionary experiences because material existence means continued
suffering or enjoying of past activities. If one has finished his rna·
terial activities then there is no more birth. This is only possible
when one begins Kr�l).a conscious activities, because such activities
do not produce reaction. Therefore, as soon as one becomes perfect
in l<f�l).a conscious activities, he is not going to take birth again in
this material world. A devotee who is not perfectly freed from the
resultant actions shquld therefore continue to act in Kr�l).a conscious­
ness seriously, even though there may be so many impediments.
When such impediments arise he should simply think of Krwa and ex­
pect His mercy. That is the only solace. If the devotee passes his days
in that spirit, it is certain that he is going to be promoted to the
abode of the Lord. By such activities, he earns his claim to enter into

the kingdom of God. The exact word used in this verse is diiyabhiik.

Diiyabhiik refers to a son's becoming the lawful inheritor of the
property of the father. In a similar way, a pure devotee who is pre­
pared to undergo all kinds of tribulations in executing Kr�l).a con­
sciousness duties becomes lawfully qualified to enter into the tran­
scendental abode.

Remembrance
I'

Some way or other, if someone establishes in his mind his con­
tinuous relationship with Kr�9-a, this relationship is called remem­
brance. About this remembrance there is a nice statement in the
Vi§"[lU Purii[la, where it is said: "Simply by remembering the Supreme
Personality of Godhead all living entities become eligible for all kinds
of auspiciousness. Therefore let me always remember the Lord, who
is unborn and eternal." In the Padma Purii!la the same remembrance
is explained as follows: "Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto
the Supreme Lord Kr�9-a, because if someone remembers Him, either
at the time of death or during his span of life, he becomes freed from
all sinful reactions."

Meditation
Meditation means to engage the mind in thinking of the form of
the Lord, of the qualities of the Lord, of the activities of the Lord
and of the service of the Lord. Meditation does not mean anything
impersonal or void. According to Vedic literature, meditation is
always on the form of Vi�9-u.
In the Nrsimha Purii[la there is a statement about meditation on
the form of the Lord. It is said there: "Meditation focusing on the
lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead has been accepted
as transcendental and beyond the experience of material pain and
pleasure. By such meditation even one who is grossly miscreant can
be delivered from the sinful reactions of his life."
In the Vi§"[lu-dharma there is a statement about meditation on the
transcendental quality of the Lord. It is said, "Persons who are con­
stantly engaged in Kr�9-a consciousness, and who remember the
transcendental qualities of the Lord, become free from all reac­
tions to sinful activities, and after being so cleansed they become
fit to enter into the kingdom of God." In other words, no one
can enter into the kingdom of God without being freed from
all sinful reactions.

Sinful reactions can be avoided simply by

Techniques of Hearing and Memorizing

93

remembering the form, qualities, pastimes, etc., of the Lord.
In the Padma Puriirw there is a statement about remembering the
activities of the Lord: "A person who is always engaged in medita­
tion on the sweet pastimes and wonderful activities of the Lord
surely becomes freed from all material contamination."

Meditation on Executing Devotional Service

In some of the Puriirws the evidence is given that if someone is
simply meditating on devotional activities, he has achieved the de­
sired result and has seen face to face the Supreme Personality of
Godhead. In this connection, there is a story in the Brahma-vaivarta

Puriirw that in the city of Prati�thanapura in South India there was
once a briihmar-a who was not very well-to-do, but who was never­
theless satisfied in himself, thinking that because of his past misdeeds,
and by the desire of Kr��a, he did not get sufficient money and opu­
lence. So he was not at all sorry for his poor material position, and
he used to live very peacefully. He was very openhearted, and some­
times he went to hear some lectures delivered by great realized souls.
At one such meeting, while he was very faithfully hearing about
Vai§r-ava activities, he was informed that these activities can be per­

formed even by meditation. In other words, if a person is unable to
actually perform

Vai§r-ava activities physically, he can meditate

upon the Vai§r-ava activities and thereby acquire all of the same re­
sults. Because the briihmar-a was not very well-to-do financially, he
decided that he would simply meditate on grand, royal devotional
activities, and he began this business thusly:
Sometimes he would take his bath in the river Godavari. After
taking his bath he would sit in a secluded place on the bank of the
river, and, by practicing the yoga exercises of prii[liiyiima, the usual
breathing exercise, he would concentrate his mind. This breathing
exercise is meant to mechanically make the mind fixed upon a par­
ticular subject. That is the result of the breathing exercise and also of
the different sitting postures of yoga. Formerly, even quite ordinary
persons used to know how to fix the mind upon the remembrance of

94

The Nectar of Devotion

the Lord, and so the briihmar-a was doing this. When he had fixed the
form of the Lord in his mind, he began to imagine in his meditations
that he was dressing the Lord very nicely in costly clothing, with
ornaments, helmets and other paraphernalia. Then he offered his re­
spectful obeisances by bowing down before the Lord. After finishing
the dressing he began to imagine that he was cleaning the temple very
nicely. After cleansing the temple, he imagined that he had many
water jugs made of gold and silver, and he took all those jugs to the
river and filled them with the holy water. Not only did he collect
water from Godavari, but he collected from the Ganges, Yamuna,
Narmada and Kaveri. Generally a Vai§r-ava, while worshiping the
Lord, collects water from all these rivers by "!-antra chanting. This
briihmar-a, instead of chanting some mantra, imagined that he was

physically securing water from all these rivers in golden and silver
water pots. Then he collected all kinds of worshipful paraphernalia­
flowers, fruits, incense and sandalwood pulp. He collected everything
to place before the Deity. All these waters, flowers and scented arti­
cles were then very nicely offered to the Deities to Their satisfaction.
Then he offered iiriitrika, and with the regulative principles he
finished all these activities in the correct worshiping method.
He would daily execute similar performances as his routine work,
and he continued to do so for many, many years. Then one day the
briihmar-a imagined in his meditations that he had prepared some

sweet rice with milk and sugar and offered the preparation to the
Deity. However, he was not very satisfied with the offering because
the sweet rice had been prepared recently and it was still very hot.
(This preparation, sweet rice, should not be taken hot. The cooler
the sweet rice, the better its taste.) So because the sweet rice was pre­
pared by the briihmar-a very recently, he wanted to touch it so that
he could know whether it was fit for eating by the Lord. As soon as
he touched the sweet rice pot with his finger, he immediately was
burnt by the heat of the pot. In this way, his meditation broke. Now,
when he looked at his finger, he saw that it was burnt, and he was
wondering in astonishment how this could have happened. Because
he was simply meditating on touching the hot sweet rice, he never
thought that his finger would actually become burnt.

95

While he was thinking like this, in V aikutltha Lord Narayatla,
seated with the goddess of fortune, Lak�mi, began to smile humor­
ously. On seeing this smiling of the Lord, all the goddesses of fortune
who were attending the Lord became very curious and asked Lord
Narayatla why He was smiling. The Lord, however, did not reply to
their inquisitiveness, but instead immediately sent for the briihma[La.
An airplane sent from Vaikutltha immediately brought the briihma[La
into Lord Narayatla 's presence. When the briihma[La was thus present
before the Lord and the goddesses of fortune, the Lord explained the
whole story. The briihma[La was then fortunate enough to get an
eternal place in Vaikutltha in the association of the Lord and His
Lak�mis. This shows how the Lord is all-pervading, in spite of His
being locally situated in His abode. Although the Lord was present
in Vaikutltha, He was present also in the heart of the briihma[La when
he was meditating on the worshiping process. Thus, we can under­
stand that things offered by the devotees even in meditation are ac­
cepted by the Lord, and they help one achieve the desired result.

ll I Aspects of Transcendental Service

Servitorship

In the opinion of the harmis (fruitive workers), offering the results
of karma is called servitorship. But according to Vai§rwva iiciiryas like
Rupa Gosvami, servitorship means to be constantly engaged in some
kind of service to the Lord.
In the Shanda Puriirw it is said that those who are attached to
ritualistic activities, the four orders of social life and the four orders
of spiritual life, are considered devotees. But when devotees are ac­
tually engaged in offering service to the Lord directly, these must be
bhiigavatas, or pure devotees. Those who are engaged in fruitive activi­

ties, or prescribed duties according to the four orders of social and
spiritual life, are not actually pure devotees. But still, because they
are offering the result to the Lord, they are accepted as devotees.
When one has no such desire, but acts spontaneously out of love of
God, such a person must be accepted as a pure devotee. The condi­
tioned souls who have come into contact with the material world are
all more or less desirous of lording it over material nature. The sys­
tem of va'!liisrama and the prescribed duties under this system are so
designed that the conditioned soul may enjoy in the material world
according to his desire for sense gratification and at the same time
gradually become elevated to spiritual understanding. Under these
prescribed duties of varr-a and iisrama there are many activities which
belong to devotional service in Kr��a consciousness. Those devotees
who are householders accept Vedic ritualistic performances as well as
the prescribed duties of devotional service, because both are meant
96

Aspects of Transcendental Service

97

for satisfying .Kr9�a. When householder devotees perform some Vedic

ritualistic duties, they do so to satisfy Kr9�a. As we have previously

discussed, any activity aiming at satisfying the Supreme Personality
of Godhead is considered devotional service.

Srila Riipa Gosvami describes one who is fit for becoming engaged
in devotional service. He says that persons who are neophytes and

who have developed a little love of Godhead are not interested in the
activities of sense gratification, in proportion to their devotion. But
if there is still some attraction for sense gratifying activities, then the

result of such activities should be offered to Kr9�a. This is also called
engagement in the service of the Lord, with the Lord as the master
and the worker as the servant.
In the Niiradiya Puriir-a there is a statement of how this servitor­
ship is transcendental. It is said there that a person who is constantly

engaged in devotional service by his body, mind and words, or even a
person who is not practically engaged but is simply desiring to be so,
is considered to be liberated.

Devotional Service in Friendship

Devotional service in friendship can be divided into two categories:
one is to act as the confidential servant of the Lord, and the other is

to act as the well-wisher of the Lord. The devotee who has confi­

dence in devotional service to the Lord systematically follows the
rules and regulations, with the faith that he will achieve the platform

of transcendental life. The second type of devotional friendship is to

become a well-wisher of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. In the
Bhagavad-gita it is said that the Lord accepts a preacher as the most
dear servant. Anyone who is preaching the confidential message of

the Gitii to the people in general is so dear to Kr9�a that no one can

be equal with him in human society.

In the Mahiibhiirata, Draupadi says, "My dear Govinda, Your prom­
ise is that Your devotee can never be vanquished. I believe in that
statement, and therefore in all kinds of tribulations I simply remem­

ber Your promise, and thus I live." The purport is that Draupadi and

The Nectar of Devotion

98

her five husbands, the Pa�9avas, were put into severe tribulations by
their cousin-brother, Duryodhana, as well as by others. The tribula­

tions were so severe that even Bhi�madeva, who was both a lifelong

brahmaciiri and a great warrior, would sometimes shed tears thinking

of them. He was always surprised that, although the Pa�9avas were
so righteous and Draupadi practically the goddess of fortune, and

although Kr��a was their friend, still they had to undergo such severe
tribulations.

Though their

tribulations

were not ordinary, still

Draupadi was not discouraged. She knew that because Kr��a was

their friend, ultimately they would be saved.
A· similar statement is there in the Eleventh Canto of Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, 2nd Chapter, 5th verse, where Havi, the son of King

J;l�abha, addresses Maharaj Nimi: "My dear King, a person who never
deviates even for a moment from engagement in service at the lotus

feet of the Supreme Person (engagement which is sought after even
by great demigods like Indra) with firm conviction that there is no­

thing more worshipable or desirable than this, is called the first-class

devotee."

Sri Riipa Gosvami says that a neophyte devotee who has simply

developed a slight love of Godhead is certainly a prospective candi­

date for devotional service. When he becomes firmly fixed in such
devotional service, that assured status becomes a confidential part of

his devotional service.

Sometimes it is found that a pure devotee lies down in the temple

of the Lord in order to serve Him as a confidential friend. Such
friendly behavior of a devotee may be accepted as riigiinugii, or spon­

taneous. Although, according to regulative principles, no one can lie

down in the temple of the Supreme Personality of Godhead, this

spontaneous love of Godhead can be grouped under devotional ser­
vice in friendship.

Regarding complete self-surrender, there is a nice description in

the Eleventh Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, 29th Chapter, 32nd verse,

where the Lord says: "A person who has completely surrendered

unto Me and has completely given up all other activities is pr otected

by Me personally, both in this life and in the next. In other words, I

wish to help him become more and more advanced in spiritual life.

Aspects of Transcendental Service

99

Such a person is to be understood as having already achieved siir�ti

[having equal opulences with the supreme] ." It is also confirmed in

the Bhagavad-gitii that as soon as a person surrenders unto the lotus

feet of Kr�r;ta, Krwa takes charge of him and gives him a guarantee

of protection from all sinful reactions. He also instructs from within,

so that the devotee may very quickly make advancement towards
spiritual perfection.

This self-surrender is called iitma-nivedana. According to different

authorities, "self" is differently defined. "Self" is sometimes con­

sidered to refer to the spirit self, or soul, and "self" is sometimes
considered to refer to the mind or to the body. Full self-surrender,

therefore, means not only surrendering one's self as spirit soul, but

also surrendering one's mind and body to the service of the Lord.

Srila Bhaktivinode Thakur has sung a nice song in this connection.

While offering himself as a fully surrendered soul, he said, "My mind,

my household affairs, my body, whatever is in my possession, my

dear Lord, I offer to You for Your service. Now You can do with

them as You like. You are the supreme possessor of everything, so if
You like You can kill me, or if You like You can give me protection.

All authority belongs to You. I have nothing to claim as my own."

Sri Yamunacarya, in his prayers to the Lord, has expressed a simi­

lar idea in the following words: "My dear Lord, I may be living with­

in some body as a human being or as a demigod, but whatever mode

of life, I do not mind, because these bodies are simply by-products of

the three modes of material nature, and I, who am in possession of

these bodies, am surrendering myself unto You."

In the Hari-bhakti-viveka, there is a statement regarding how one

can offer his body in self-surrender. There the devotee says, "My
dear Lord, as a sold-out animal has no need to think about his main­

tenance and sustenance, so, because I have given U(>' my body and

soul unto You, I am no longer concerned with my maintenance and
sustenance." In other words, one should not bother about his per­
sonal or family maintenance or sustenance. If one is actually surren­

dered in body and soul, he should always remember that his only
concern is to be engaged in the service of the Lord.

Srila Rupa Gosvami says that devotional service in friendship and

100

The Nectar of Devotion

devotional service in self-surrender are two difficult processes. There­
fore such relationships with the Lord can very rarely be seen. Only
for the advanced devotees are these two processes easily executed.
The purport is that it is very rare to see surrender which is mixed
with sincere ecstatic devotion. One must give himself completely to
the will of the Lord.

In the Eleventh Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, 40th verse, llth

Chapter, Lord Kr��a tells Uddhava: "My dear friend, if someone
offers Me the best thing in his possession, or anything which is very
pleasing to him, he will be eternally benefitted."

In the Niirada-paiicariitra there is a statement of how one can act

in all spheres of life for the satisfaction of the Lord. It is stated there
that a person who is actually in devotional service must be engaged
in all kinds of activities, those prescribed in the revealed scriptures
and also those which are accepted for livelihood. In other words, a
devotee should engage himself not only in the prescribed duties of
devotional service which are mentioned in the revealed scriptures, but
he should also perform the duties of his practical life in Kr��a con­
sciousness. For example, a devotee who has a great establishment, or
factory, may offer the fruits of such a material possession for the ser­
vice of the Lord.

In the Hari-bhakti-viliisa there is the following statement about

self-surrender: "My dear Lord, a person who has surrendered himself
unto You, and who is in firm conviction that he is Yours, and ac­
tually acts in that way by his body, mind and words, can actually
relish transcendental bliss."

In the Nrsirhha Puriir.a, Lord Nrsimhadeva says: "Anyone who

prays unto Me and takes shelter from Me becomes My ward, and I
protect him always from all sorts of calamities."

Serving Trees such as the Tulasi
In the Skanda Puriir.a there is a statement eulogizing the tulasi tree

as follows: "Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto the tulasi

tree, which can immediately vanquish volumes of sinful activities.

Aspects of Transcendental Service

101

Simply by seeing or touching this tree one can become relieved from
all distresses and diseases. Simply by offering obeisances to and pour­
ing water on the tulasi tree, one can become freed from the fear of
being sent to the court of Y amaraj [the King of death, who punishes
the sinful] " If someone sows a tulasi tree somewhere, certainly he
.

becomes devoted to Lord K{��a. And when the tulasi leaves are of­
fered in devotion at the lotus feet of Kr��a, there is the full develop­
ment of love of Godhead.
In India every Hindu, even those not belonging to the Vai§!lava
group, take special care of the tulasi tree. Even in great cities where
it is very difficult to keep a tulasi tree, people are to be found very
carefully keeping this plant. They water it and offer obeisances to it,
because worship of the tulasi tree is very important in devotional
serVIce.
In the Skanda Purii!la there is another statement about tulasi, as
follows: "Tulasi is auspicious in all respects. Simply by seeing, simply
by touching, simply by remembering, simply by praying to, simply
by bowing before, simply by hearing about or simply by sowing this
tree, there is always auspiciousness. Anyone who comes in touch
with the tulasi tree in the above-mentioned ways lives eternally in
the V aiku�tha world."

12 I Revealed Scriptures

According to Srila Riipa Gosvami, any book which gives enlighten­
ment in the matter of advancing devotional service is considered to

be revealed scripture. Srila Madhvacarya has also defined revealed
scriptures as referring to books such as the Riimiiyar-a, Mahiibhiirata,

Puriir-as, Upani§ads, Ve diinta and any other literature which is writ­
ten in pursuance of such revealed scriptures.
-

In the Skanda Puriir-a there is the statement, "A person who is

constantly engaged in reading literature enunciating the cultivation
of V ai�pava devotional service is always glorious in human society,

and certainly Lord Krwa becomes pleased with him. A person who
very carefully keeps such literature at home and offers respectful
obeisances to it

becomes freed from all sinful reactions and ulti­

mately becomes worshipable by the demigods."

It is also said to Narada Muni: "My dear Narada, a person who

writes V aiwava literature and keeps such literature at home has Lord
Narayapa always residing in his house."

In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, Twelfth Canto, 12th Chapter, 12th
verse, it is stated: "Srimad-Bhiigavatam is the essence of all Vedanta

philosophy. Any person who has become attached in some way or

other to the reading of Srimqd-Bhiigavatam cannot have any taste for

reading any other literature.

In other words, a person who has

relished the transcendental bliss of Srimad-Bhiigavatam cannot be
satisfied with mundane writings."

In the Variiha Puriir-a there is a statement praising the residen­

tial quarters of Mathura. Lord V araha tells the men of earth: "Any

person who becomes attracted to places other than Mathura will
certainly be captivated by the illusory energy." In the Brahmiirtfla

Puriirw it is said that all the results of traveling on all the pilgrimages

within the three worlds can be achieved simply by touching the holy

land of Mathura. In many siistras (scriptures) it is said that simply by
hearing, remembering, glorifying, desiring, seeing, or touching the
land of Mathura, one can achieve all desires.
In the Padma Purii[ta, there is a nice statement praising the ser­

vice of the Vai§rtavas or devotees. In that scripture Lord Siva tells
Parvati, "My dear Parvati, there are different methods of worship,

and out of all such methods the worship of the Supreme Person is
considered to be the highest. But even higher than the worship of the
Lord is the worship of the Lord's devotees."

A similar statement is in the Third Canto, 7th Chapter, 19th verse,

of the Srimad-Bhiigavatam: "Let me become a sincere servant of the
devotees

because by serving them one can achieve unalloyed devo­

tional service unto the lotus feet of the Lord. The service of devotees

diminishes all miserable material conditions and develops within one

a deep devotional love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead."

In the Skanda Puriirta there is a similar statement: "Persons whose

bodies are marked with tilaka, symbolizing the conchshell, wheel,

club and lotus-and who keep the leaves of tulasi on their heads, and

whose bodies are always decorated with g opi- c anda na

-

even seen

once, can help the seer be relieved from all sinful activities."

A similar statement is found in the First Canto, 19th Chapter, 30th

verse, of the Srimad-Bhiigavatam: "There is no doubt about one's be­

coming freed from all reactions to sinful activities after visiting. a

devotee or touching his lotus feet or giving him a sitting place. Even

by remembering the activities of such Vai§rtavas, one becomes puri­

fied, along with his whole family. And what, then, can be said of ren­

dering direct service to him?"
In the Adi Puriirta there is the following statement by Lord Kr�l).a
Himself, addressed to Arj una: "My dear Partha, one who claims to

be My devotee is not so. Only a person who claims to be the devotee
of My devotee is actually My devotee." No one can approach the
Supreme Personality of Godhead directly. One must approach Him

The Nectar of Devotion

104

through His pure devotees. Therefore, in the system of Vai§rz,ava
activities, the first duty is to accept a devotee as spiritual master and
then to render service unto him.

Sri Riipa Gosvami affirms that all the quotations given in the
Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu from different scriptures are accepted by the
great acaryas and devotees of the Lord.

In the Padma Purarz,a there is a statement that one should perform
the ceremonies for the Lord according to one's financial position.
Everyone should observe the different ceremonies and celebrations
of the Lord by all means. One of the most important of these cere­
monial functions is called Vrja-vrata. Urja-vrata is observed in the
month of Karttika (October-November); especially in V rndavana,
there is a specific program for temple worship of the Lord in His
Damodara form. Damodara refers to Kr��a's being bound with rope
by His mother, Yasoda. It is said that just as Lord Damodara is very
dear to His devotees so the month known as Damodara or Karttika
is also very dear to them.
The execution of devotional service during Orja-vrata in the month
of Karttilw is especially recommended to be p.erformed at Mathura.
This system is still followed by many devotees. They go to Mathura
or Vrndavana and stay there during the month of Karttika specifically
to perform devotional services during this period.
In the Padma Purarz,a it is said: "The Lord may offer liberation or
material happiness to a devotee, but after some devotional service has
been executed, particularly in Mathura during the month of Karttika,
the devotees want only to attain pure devotional service unto the
Lord." The purport is that the Lord does not award devotional ser­
vice to ordinary persons who are not serious about it. But even such
unserious persons who execute devotional service according to the
regulative principles during the month of Karttika, and within the .
jurisdiction of Mathura in India, are very easily awarded the Lord's
personal service.
In the Bhavi§ya Purarz,a there is a statement about observing dif­
ferent ceremonies celebrating the Lord's appearance (birthday) and
other

transcendental

activities. It

is said, "My Lord Janardana

Revealed Scriptures

105

(Kr�!la], please let us know the date when Your mother Devaki
devi gave birth to You. If You kindly inform us about this, then
we shall observe a

great celebration on this date. 0 killer of

Kesi, we are souls one hundred percent surrendered unto Your
lotus feet, and we wish only to please You with our ceremonies."

This statement of the Bhavi§ya Purii[la gives evidence that by ob­

serving different functions in relationship with the Lord one is sure
to become pleasing to the Lord. It is said in the Adi Purii[ta: "A per­

son who is constantly engaged in chanting the holy name and who
feels transcendental pleasure, being engaged in devotional service, is
certainly awarded the facilities of devotional service, and is never

given just mukti [liberation].

"

Mukti means liberation from material contamination; when lib­

erated, one does not have to take birth again in the material world. The
impersonalists desire to merge into the spiritual existence, to end

their individual existence, but according to Srimad-Bhiigavatam,

mukti is only the beginning of one's becoming situated in his normal
condition. The normal condition of every living entity is to be en­
gaged in the devotional service of the Lord. From the statement of

the .ifdi Purii[la it appears that a devotee is satisfied simply with being

engaged in devotional service. He does not aspire for any liberation
from material conditional life. In other words, anyone who is en­
gaged in devotional service is not in the material condition of life,
although he may appear so.

R e ci t ati o n of Srimad-Bhiigavatam

Srimad-Bhiigavatam is the desire-tree of Vedic wisdom. Veda itself
means the aggregate of knowledge. And whatever knowledge is re­

quired for human society is perfectly presented in the Srimad­

Bhiigavatam. There are different branches of knowledge in the Vedic
writings, including sociology, politics, medicine and military art. All
these and other branches of knowledge are perfectly described in the

Vedas. So, as far as spiritual knowledge is concerned, that is also per­

fectly described there, and Srimad-Bhiigavatam is considered to be

106

The Nectar of Devotion

the ripened fruit of this desire-fulfilling tree of the Vedas. A tree is
honored by the production of its fruit. For example, a mango tree is

considered very valuable because it produces the king of all fruits, the

mango. When the mango fruit becomes ripened it is the greatest gift

of that tree, and Srimad-Bhiigavatam is similarly held to be the ripened
fruit of the Vedic tree. And, as ripened fruit becomes more relish­

able when first touched by the beak of a parrot, or suka, so Srimad­
Bhagavatam has become more relishable by being delivered through
the transcendental mouth of Sukadeva Gosvami.

Srimad-Bhagavatam should be received in disciplic succession with­

out any breakage. When a ripened fruit comes from the upper part of

the tree onto the ground by the process of being handed down from

a higher branch to a lower branch by persons in the tree, the fruit

does not break. Srimad-Bhiigavatam, when received in the paramparii

system, or disciplic succession, will likewise remain unbroken. It is
stated in the Bhagavad-gitii that the disciplic succession, or paramparii,

is the way of receiving transcendental knowledge. Such knowledge

must come down through the disciplic succession, through authorized
persons who know the real purpose of the siistra.

Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu recommended that one learn Srimad­

Bhagavatam from the mouth of the self realized person called bhiiga­
vatam. Bhiigavata means "in relationship with the Personality of God­
head (Bhagaviin ) . " So the devotee is sometimes called bhiigavatam,

and the book which is in relationship with devotional service to the
Supreme Personality of Godhead is also called Bhiigavatam. Sri

Caitanya Mahaprabhu recommended that in order to relish the real

taste of Srimad-Bhagavatam, one should take instruction from the
person bhiigavatam. Srimad-Bhiigavatam is relishable even by a lib­

erated person. It was admitted by Sukadeva Gosvami that although

he was liberated fro_m within the very womb of his mother, it was
only after relishing Srzmad-Bhiigavatam that he became a great devo­
tee. Thus, one who is desirous of advancing in Kr�l).a consciousness
should relish the purport of

Srima d-Bhagavatam through the dis­

cussions of authorized devotees.
In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, Second Canto, lst Cha pter, 9th verse,

S ukadeva Gosvami admits that although he was very much attracted

Revealed Scriptures

107

by the impersonal Brahman, when he heard the transcendental pas­

times of the Supreme Personality of Godhead from the mouth of his

father, Vyasadeva, he became more attracted to Srimad-Bhagavatam.

The idea is that Vyasadeva was also a self realized soul, and his mature

contribution of transcendental knowledge was delivered directly to
Sukadeva Gosvam'i in the manner indicated.

The importance of discussing Srimad-Bhagavatam in the society of

pure devotees is explained by Saunaka Muni during the meeting at
Naimi9ara�ya, in the presence of Silta Gosvam'i. Silta Gosvami con­
firmed that if someone is fortunate enough to associate with a pure

devotee of the Lord even for a moment, that particular moment is so

valuable that even those pious activities which can promote one to

the heavenly planets or give liberation from material miseries cannot

compare with it. In other words, those who are attached to Srimad­

Bhiigavatam do not care for any kind of benefit derived from eleva­
tion to the higher planetary kingdoms, or for the liberation which is
conceived of by the impersonalists. As such, the association of pure

devotees is so transcendentaliy valuable that no kind of material
happiness can compare with it.

.

In the Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya there is a conversation between

Prahlada Maharaj and his father, Hira�yakasipu, in which HiraQ.ya­

kasipu addresses Prahlada in this way: "My dear son, association is
very important. It acts just like a crystal-stone which will reflect any­

thing which is put before it." Similarly, if we associate with the

flowerlike devotees of the Lord, and if our hearts are crystal clear,

then certainly the same action will be there. Another example given

in this connection is that if a man is potent and if a woman is not
diseased, then by their conjugation there will be conception. In the

same way, if the recipient of spiritual knowledge and the deliverer of

spiritual knowledge are sincere and bona fide, there will be good

results.

13 I The Maha-mantra

The importance of chanting Hare K[§!W, Hare K[§!W, K[§fla K[§!W,

Hare Hare/ Hare Riima, Hare Riima, Riima Riima, Hare Hare is very

strongly stressed in the Second Canto, lst Chapter, 11th verse, of the

Srimad-Bhiigavatam in the following way:

S ukadeva Gosvami tells

Maharaj Parik�it: "My dear King, if one is spontaneously attached to

the chanting of the Hare K[§[W mahii-mantra, it is to be understood

that he has attained the highest perfectional stage." It is specifically

mentioned that the karmis who are aspiring after the fruitive results
of their activities, the salvationists who are aspiring to become one
with the Supreme Person, and the yogis who are aspiring after mystic
perfections can achieve the results of all perfectional stages simply

by chanting the mahii-mantra.

S ukadeva uses the word ni'[litam,

which means "it is already decided." He was a liberated soul and
therefore could not accept anything which was not conclusive. So

S ukadeva Gosvami especially stresses that it is already concluded that

one who has come to the stage of chanting the Hare K[§!W mantra
with determination and steadiness must be considered as having al­
ready passed the trials of fruitive activities, mental speculation and

mystic yoga.
The same thing is confirmed in the .ifdi Puriirta by Kg;!la. While
addressing Arjuna He says, "Anyone who is engaged in chanting My

transcendental name must be considered to be always associating
with Me. And I may tell you frankly that for such a devotee I become
easily purchased."

In the Padma Puriirta also it is stated: "The chanting of the Hare
r§rta
mantra is present only on the lips of a person who has for
K
108

The Mahii-mantra

109

many births worshiped Vasudeva." It is further said in the Padma

Puriir-a: "There is no difference between the holy name of the Lord
and the Lord Himself. As such, the holy name is as perfect as the
Lord Himself in fullness, purity and eternity. The holy name is
no material sound vibration, nor has it any material contamination."
The holy name cannot, therefore, be chanted offenselessly by one
who has failed to purify his senses. In other words, materialistic
senses cannot properly chant the holy names of the Hare Kr�r-a

mahii-mantra. But, by adopting this chanting process, one is given a
chance to actually purify himself so that he may very soon chant
offenselessly.
Caitanya Mahaprabhu has recommended that everyone chant the

Hare Kr�r-a mantra just to cleanse the dust from the heart. If the dust
of the heart is cleansed away, then one can actually understand the
importance of the holy name. For persons who are not inclined to
clean the dust from their heart and want to keep things as they are,
it is not possible to derive the transcendental result of chanting the

Hare Kr�r-a mantra. One should, therefore, be encouraged to develop
his service attitude toward the Lord, because this will help him to
chant without any offense. And so, under the guidance of a spiritual
master, the disciple is trained simultaneously to render service and
at the same time to chant the Hare Kr�r-a mantra. As soon as one
develops his spontaneous service attitude, he can immediately under­
stand the transcendental nature of the holy names of the mahii­

mantra.
In the Padma Puriir-a there is a statement about the importance of
living at holy places like Mathura or Dvaraka. It is stated there: "To
travel to different places of pilgrimage means to attain emancipation
from material bondage. This emancipation, however, is not the high·
est perfectional stage. After attaining this liberated stage, one has to
become engaged in devotional service to the Lord. After attainment
of the brahma-bhiita (liberation] stage one can further advance to
engagement in devotional service. So this attainment of transcenden­
tal loving devotional service to the Lord is the goal of life, and it can
be achieved very easily for one who lives in Mathura-ma��ala even
for a few seconds."

llO

The Nectar of Devotion

It is further said: "Who is that person who will not agree to wor­
ship the land of Mathura? Mathura can deliver all the desires and
ambitions of the fruitive workers and of the salvationists, who desire
to become one with the supreme Brahman. Certainly Mathura will

deliver the desires of the devotees, who simply aspire to be engaged
in the devotional service of the Lord." In the Vedic literature it is
also stated: "How wonderful it is that simply by residing in Mathura
even for one day, one can achieve a transcendental loving attitude
toward the Supreme Personality of Godhead! This land of Mathura
must be more glorious than Vaiku�tha-dhama, the kingdom of God!"
Riipa Gosvami has stated that the five kinds of devotional activities
-namely, residing in Mathura, worshiping the Deity of the Lord,

reciting Srimad-Bhiigavatam,

serving a devotee, and chanting the

Hare K[§!W ma n t ra -are so potent that a small attachment for any

one of these five items can arouse devotional ecstasy even in a neo­
phyte.
Regarding worship of the form of the Lord, or Deity, Riipa Go­
svami has written the following verse: "My dear friends, if you still
have any desire to enjoy the company of your friends within this
material world, then don't look upon the form of Kr��a, who is
standing on the bank of Kesi-ghat [a bathing place in Vrndavana] .
He is known as Govinda, and His eyes are very enchanting. He is
playing upon His flute, and on His head there is a peacock feather.
And His whole body is illuminated by the moonlight in the sky."
The purport of this verse is that if someone becomes attached to

the Sri Miirti, or Deity of Kr��a, by worshiping at home, then he will
forget his relationship of so-called friendship, love and society. Thus
it is the duty of every householder to install Deities of the Lord at
home and to begin the process of worshiping along with all of his
family members. This will save everyone from such unwanted activi­
ties as going to clubs, cinemas, dancing parties, smoking; drinking,
etc. All such nonsense will be forgotten if one stresses the worship of
the Deities at home.

·

Riipa Gosvami further writes, "My dear foolish friend, I think that

you have already heard some of the auspicious Srimad-Bhiigavatam,

The Mahii-mantra

111

which decries seeking the results of fruitive activities, economic de­

velopment and liberation_ I think now it is certain that gradually the

verses of the Tenth Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, describing the
pastimes of the Lord, will enter your ears and go into your heart."

In the beginning of the Srimad-Bhiigavatam it is said that unless

one has the capacity to throw out, just like garbage, the fruitive
results of ritualistic ceremonies, economic development and becoming

one with the supreme (or salvation), one cannot understand Srimad­
Bhiigavatam. The Bhiigavatam deals exclusively with devotional ser­
vice. Only one who studies Srimad-Bhiigavatam in the spirit of
renunciation can understand the pastimes of the Lord which are de­

scribed in the Tenth Canto. In other words, one should not try to

understand the topics of the Tenth Canto, such as the riisa-lilii (love
dance), unless he has spontaneous attraction for Srimad-Bhiigavatam.

One must be situated in pure devotional service before he can relish

Srimad-Bhiigavatam as it is.

·

In the above two verses of Rupa Gosvami there ar:e some meta­
phorical analogies, which indirectly condemn the association of ma­

terialistic society, friendship and love. People are generally attracted

to society, friendship and love, and make elaborate arrangements and

strong endeavors to develop these material contaminations; but to
see the Sri Miirtis of Radha and Kr�!la is to forget such endeavors for

material association. Rupa Gosvami composed his verse in such a way
that he was seemingly praising the material association of friend­

ship, love, etc., and was condemning the audience of Sri Miirti or
Govinda. This metaphorical analogy is constructed in such a way that

things which seem to be eulogized are condemned, and things which

are to be condemned are eulogized. The actual import of the verse is
that one must see the form of Govinda if one at all wants to forget

the nonsense of material friendship, love and society.
Srila Rupa Gosvami has similarly described the transcendental na··

ture of relishing topics which. concern Kr�!J.a. A devotee once said,

"It is very astonishing that since I have seen this Personality of God­
head who is washed by the tears of my eyes, there is shivering of my

body, and He has made me a failure in executing my material duties.

Since seeing Him I cannot remain silently at home. I wish to go out

112

The Nectar of Devotion

to Him always." The purport of this statement is that as soon as one
is fortunate enough to contact a pure devotee, he must be anxious
immediately to hear about Kr�!J.a, to learn about Kr�!J.a, or, in other
words, to become fully Kr�!la conscious.
Similarly, there· is a statement about hearing and chanting the
mahii-mantra: "It is said that saints have been able to hear the vi­
brating strings of the virtii in the hands of Narada, who is always
singing the glories of Lord Kr�!J.a. Now this same sound vibration has
entered my ears, and I am always feeling the presence of the Supreme
Personality. Gradually I am becoming bereft of all attachment for
material enjoyment."
Again, he has described Mathura"ma!J.I).ala: "I remember the Lord
standing by the banks of the Yamuna River, so beautiful amidst the
kadamba trees, where many birds are chirping in the gardens. And
these impressions are always giving me transcendental realization of
beauty and bliss." This feeling about Mathura-ma!J.I).ala and Vrnda­
vana by Riipa Gosvami can actually be felt even by nondevotees. The
places in the eighty-four-square-mile district of Mathura are so beauti­
fully situated on the banks of the river Yamuna that anyone who
goes there will never want to return to this material world. These
statements by Riipa Gosvami are factually realized descriptions of
Mathura and Vrndavana. All these qualities prove that Mathura and
Vrndavana are situated transcendentally. Otherwise, there is no pos­
sibility of invoking our transcendental sentiments in these places.
Such transcendental feelings are aroused immediately and without
fail after one arrives in Mathura or Vrndavana.
In these statements about devotional service, sometimes it may
appear that the results have been overestimated; but actually there is
no overestimation. Some devotees, as is evidenced from revealed
scriptures, have had immediate results by such association, although
this is not possible for all. For example, the Kumaras immediately
became devotees simply by smelling the incense in the temple.
Bilvamailgala Thakur simply heard about Kr�!la and then immediately
gave up his beautiful girl friend and started out for Mathura and
Vrndavana, where he became a perfect Vai§rtava. So these statements

The Mahii-mantra

113

are not overestimations, nor are they stories. They are actual facts,
but are true for certain devotees and do not necessarily apply to all.
These descriptions, even if considered overestimations, must be taken
as they are in order to divert our attention from the fleeting material
beauty to the eternal beauty of Kr�!la consciousness. And for a per­
son who is already in contact with Kr�!!a consciousness, the described
results are not unusual.
Some scholars argue that simply by following the principles of

va'?la and iisrama one can gradually rise up to the perfections reached

by practicing devotional service, but this argument is not accepted by
the great authorities. Lord Caitanya also condemned this idea while
He was talking with Ramananda Rai about the gradual development
of devotional service. He rejected the idea of the importance of

var[tiisrama-dharma when it was put forward by Ramananda Rai. He
said that this advancement of va'?la and iisrama is merely external.

There is a higher principle. In the Bhagavad-gitii also the Lord says

that one has to give up all other principles of elevation and take
simply to the method of Kr�!!a consciousness. That will help him in
achieving the highest perfection of life.

In _the Eleventh Canto, 20th Chapter, 8th verse, of the Srimad­
Bhiigavatam the Lord Himself says: "One should execute the pre­
scribed duties of vaqw and iisrama as long as he has not developed

spontaneous attachment for hearing about My pastimes and activi­
ties." In other words, the prescribed forms of vaqw and iisrama are

ritualistic ceremonies of reli gion intended for economic development,

sense gratification or for salvation. All of these things are recom­
mended for persons who have not developed Krwa consciousness; in

fact, all such activities are recommended in the revealed scriptures
only to bring one to the point of Kr�!la consciousness. But one who

has already developed spontaneous attachment for Krwa does not
require to execute the duties prescribed in the scriptures.

14 I Devotional Qualifications

Some scholars recommend that knowledge and renunciation are

important factors for elevating oneself to devotional service. But

actually that is not a fact. Actually, the cultivation of knowledge or

renunciation, which are favorable for achieving a footing in Kr�!la

consciousness, may be accepted in the beginning, but ultimately they

may also come to be rejected, for devotional service is dependent on
nothing other than the sentiment or desire for such service. It re­
quires nothing more than sincerity.
It is the opinion of expert devotees that mental speculation and
the artificial austerities of yoga practice may be favorable for be­
coming liberated from material contamination, but they will also
make one's heart harder and harder. They will not help at all in the
progress of devotional service. These processes are, therefore, not
favorable for entering into. the transcendental loving service of the
Lord. Actually Krwa consciousness-devotional service itself-is the
only way of advancing in devotional life. Devotional service is ab­
solute; it is both the cause and the effect. The Supreme Personality

of Godhead is the cause and effect of all that be, and to approach
Him, the absolute, the process of devotional service-which is also
absolute-has to be adopted.

This is confirmed in the Bhagavad-gitii by the Lord Himself: "One

can understand Me only through devotional service." In beginning
His teaching of the Gitii, the Lord said to Arjuna, "Because you are

My devotee I shall teach these secrets to you." Vedic knowledge

means ultimately to understand the Supreme Lord, and the process
of entering into His kingdom is devotional service. That is accepted
114

Devotional Qualifications

115

by all authentic scriptures. Mental speculators neglect the' process of
devotional service, and by simply trying to defeat others in philo­
sophical research they fail to develop the ecstasy of devotion.

In the Eleventh Canto, 20th Chapter, 31st verse, of the Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, Kr�J).a says, "My dear Uddhava, for persons who are

seriously engaged in My service, the cultivation of philosophical specu­

lation and artificial renunciation are not very favorable. When a per­
son becomes My devotee he automatically attains the fruits of the
renunciation of material enjoyment, and he gets sufficient know­

ledge to understand the absolute truth." That is the test of advance­

ment in devotional service. A devotee cannot be in darkness because
the Lord shows him special favor and enlightens him from within.

In the Eleventh Canto, 20th Chapter, 32nd and 33rd verses, of the

Srimad-Bhiigavatam the Lord further instructs Uddhava: "My dear
friend, the profits derived from fruitive activities, austerities, the cul­

ture of philosophical knowledge, renouncement, the practice of

mystic yoga, charity and all similar auspicious activities are auto­

matically �chieved by My devotees-those who are simply attached
to Me by loving service. These devotees have everything at their dis­

posal, but they desire nothing outside of My devotional service. If

ever a devotee should desire some material profit-to be promoted
to the heavenly planets-or some spiritual profit-to go to the Vai­

kul).thas-by My causeless mercy their desires are very easily fulfilled."

Actually a person who is developing l(r�J).a consciousness and still

has some attachment to material enjoyment will soon be freed from

such a tendency by regularly discharging devotional service under the

instruction of a bona fide spiritual master.
Srila Rilpa Gosvam1, then, recommends that one should not be at­

tached to material sense enjoyment, but accept everything enjoyable

which is in relationship to Kr�J).a. For example, eating is necessary,

and one wants some palatable dishes to satisfy his sense of taste.

So in that case, for the satisfaction of Krsna
... rather than for the
satisfaction of the tongue, some palatable dishes may be prepared
and offered to Kr�J).a. Then it is renunciation. Let the palatable

dishes be prepared, but unless they are offered to Kr�J).a one should

not accept them for eating. This vow of rejecting anything which is

The Nectar of Devotion

116

not offered to Kr�!la is actually renunciation. And by such reimncia­
tion one is able to satisfy the demands of the senses.
The impersonalists who try to avoid everything material may un­
dergo severe austerities, but they miss the opportunity of being en­
gaged in the service of the Lord. Thus their renunciation is not suf­
ficient for perfection. There are many instances where, following such
artificial renunciation without any contact with devotional service,
the impersonalist again fell down and became attracted to the ma­
terial contamination. There are many supposed renouncers even at
the present moment who officially become sannyiisis or renouncers
and outwardly claim that spiritual existence is truth and material
existence untruth. In this way, artificially they make a show of re­
nunciation of the material world. However, because they cannot
reach the point of devotional service, they fail to achieve the goal and
again come back to material activities, such as philanthropic work,
political agitation, etc. There are many instances of so-called sann­
yiisis who gave up the world as untruth, but again came to the ma­

terial world because they were not seeking their real repose at the
lotus feet of the Lord.
One should not give up anything which can be utilized in the ser­
vice of the Lord. That is a secret of devotional service. Anything that
can be utilized in advancing Kr�!la consciousness and devotional ser­
vice should be accepted. For instance, we are using many machines for

the advancement of our present Kr�!la consciousness movement, ma­
chines like typewriters, dictaphones, tape recorders, microphones and
airplanes. Sometimes people ask us, "Why are you utilizing material
products if you condemn the advancement of material civilization?"
But actually we do not condemn. We simply ask people to do what­
ever they are doing in Krgta consciousness. This is the same principle
on which, in the Bhagavad-gitii, Kr�!la advised Arjuna to utilize his
fighting abilities in devotional service. Similarly, we are utilizing these
machines for Krsna's service. With such sentiment for Krsna, or Krsna
.

.

consciousness, we can accept everything. If the typewriter can be
utilized for advancing our Kr�!la consciousness movement, we must
accept it. Similarly, the dictaphone or any other machine must be
used. Our vision is that Kr�!la is everything. Kr�!la is the cause and

Devotional Qualifications

117

effect, and nothing belongs to us. Krwa's things must be used in the
service of Kr�!la. That is our vision.

This does not mean, however, that we should give up the principles

of discharging devotional service or neglect abiding by the rules and
regulations prescribed therein. In the neophyte stage of devotion one

must follow all the principles, regulated by the authority of the spiri­
tual master. The acceptance and rejection of things should always be
in pursuance of the devotional principles; not that one can indepen­

dentl y manufacture some idea of what should be accepted or rej�cted.

The spiritual master as the visible manifestation of Kr�!la is necessary,

therefore, to direct the devotee on behalf of the Supreme Personality

of Godhead.

The spiritual master must never be carried away by an accumula­

tion of wealth or a large number of followers. A bona fide spiritual
master will never become like that. But sometimes, if a spiritual mas­

ter is not properly authorized, and only on his own initiative becomes
a spiritual master, he may be carried away by an accumulation of
wealth and large numbers of disciples. His is not a very high grade of

devotional service. If a person is carried away by such achievements,
then his devotional service becomes slackened. One should, therefore,
strictly adhere to the principles of disciplic succession.

A Krwa conscious person, being naturally purified, has no need

of developing any other purificatory process of thought or action.

On account of his being highly elevated in Kr�!la consciousness, he

has already acquired all the good qualities and is following the rules

and regulations prescribed for the mystic yogic process. Such rules
are automatically practiced by the devotees. A concrete example is
the quality of nonviolence, which is considered a good qualification.

A devotee is naturally nonviolent and therefore doesn't have to prac­

tice nonviolence separately. Some people seek purification by joining
a vegetarian movement, but a devotee is automatically a vegetarian.
He doesn't need to .practice separately in this matter or to join any

society for vegetarians. He is automatically a vegetarian.

There are many other instances showing that a devotee needn't

practice anything but Kr�!la consciousness; all the good qualities of

the demigods automatically develop within him. Those who are in-

118

The Nectar of Devotion

tentionally practicing to be vegetarians or to become nonviolent may
have good qualifications by a material estimation, but these qualifica­
tions are not sufficient to make them devotees. A vegetarian is not
necessarily a devotee, nor is a nonviolent person. But a devotee is
automatically both vegetarian and nonviolent. We must conclude,
therefore, that vegetarianism or nonviolence is not the cause of devo­
tion.

In this connection, there is a story in the Shanda Purar-a about a

hunter who was converted into a great devotee under the instruction
of Narada Muni. When the hunter became a perfect devotee, he was
not prepared even to kill an ant. Parvata Muni, a friend of Narada's,
saw the wonderful transformation of the hunter by devotional ser­
vice, and remarked: "My dear hunter, your unwillingness to kill even

an ant is not very astonishing. Any person who develops the devo­
tional attitude has all the good qualities automatically manifested in
his person. A devotee is never a cause of distress to anyone."

Sri Rupa Gosvami affirms herein that purification of consciousness,

purification of bodily activities, austerities, peace of mind, etc., all
become automatically manifest in the person who is engaged in devo­
tional service.

S ri Rupa Gosvami affirms herein that there are nine different kinds

of devotional service, which are listed as hearing, chanting, remem­
bering, serving, worshiping the Deity in the temple, praying, carrying
out orders, serving Him as a friend and sacrificing everything for Him.
Each and every one of these processes is so powerful that if anyone
follows even one single one of them, he can achieve the desired per­
fection without fail. For example, if one is attached simply to hearing
about the Lord, and another is attached to chanting the glories of the
name, both will achieve their desired goal in devotional service. In the

Caitanya�caritamrta this has been explained. One may execute one,

two, three or all the different processes of devotional service, and at
the ultimate end he will achieve the desired goal of being established
in devotional service.
There are concrete examples of how a devotee discharged one of
these services and achieved perfection. King Parik�it achieved the

desired goal of life simply by hearing Srimad-Bhiigavatam. S ukadeva

Devotional Qualifi<;ations

119

Gosvami achieved the desired goal of life simply by reciting Srimad­

Bhiigavatam. PrahHi.da Mahadi.j became successful in his devotional
service by always remembering the Lord. Lak9mi, the goddess of for­

tune, was successful by engaging herself in massaging the lotus feet of

the Lord. King Prthu became successful by worshiping in the temple.
Akrura became successful by offering prayers. Hanuman became suc­

cessful by rendering personal service to Lord Ramacandra. Arjuna

became successful by being a friend of Krwa. And Bali Maharaj be­
came successful simply by offering all of his possessions to Kr9!1a.

There are also examples of devotees who discharged all the differ­

ent items together. In the Ninth Canto, 4th Chapter, 15th, 16th and
17th verses, of the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, there is a statement about

Maharaj Ambari9a, who followed every one of the devotional process­

es. In these verses, Sukadeva Gosvami says, "King Ambari9a first of

all concentrated his mind on the lotus feet of Lord Kr9!1a and then

engaged his speech in describing the pastimes and activities of the
Lord. He engaged his hands in washing the temple of the Lord. He

engaged his ears in hearing of the transcendental glories of the Lord.
He engaged his eyes in seeing the beautiful Deity in the temple. He

engaged his body in associating with the pure devotees of the Lord.
[When you associate with someone you have to sit down together,

eat together, etc.-and in this way the touch of your body with their
body is inevitable. Ambari9a l\1aharaj made his association only with
pure devotees and did not allow his body to be touched by anyone

else.] He engaged his nostrils in smelling the flowers and tulasi which

were offered to Kr9!!a, and he engaged his tongue in tasting Kr�!!a­

prasiidam [food prepared specifically for offering to the Lord, the

remnants of which are taken by the devotees] . Maharaj Ambari9a was

able to offer very nice prasiidam to Krwa because he was a king and
had no scarcity of finance. He used to offer Kr9!1a the most royal

dishes and would then taste the remnants as Kr9!!a-prasiidam. There
was no scarcity in his royal style because he had a very beautiful

temple wherein the Deity of the Lord was decorated with costly
paraphernalia and offered high grade food. So everything was avail­

able, and his engagement was always completely in Kr9!1a conscious­

ness."

120

The Nectar of Devotion

The idea is that we should follow in the footsteps of great devo­
tees. If we are unable to execute all the different items of devotional
service� we must try to execute at least one of them, as exemplified
by previous iiciiryas. If we are engaged in the execution of all the
items of devotional service, as was Maharaj Ambari�a, then the per­
fection of devotional service is guaranteed from each one of these
items. With the first complete engagement, one becomes automatical­
ly detached from material contamination, and liberation becomes the
maidservant of the devotee. This idea is confirmed by Bilvamangala
Thakur: If one develops unalloyed devotion to the Lord, liberation
will follow the devotee as his maidservant.

Srila Rupa Gosvami says that the regulative principles of devo­

tional service are sometimes described by authorities as the path of
serving tht Lord in opulence.

15 I Spontaneous Devotional Service

The examples of spontaneous devotional service can be easily seen
in Kr�J)a's direct associates in V rndavana. The spontaneous dealings
of the residents of V rndavana in relationship with Kr�J)a are called

riigiinugii. These beings don't have to learn anything about devotional
service; they are already perfect in all regulative principles and have
achieved the spontaneous loving service of the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. For example, the cowherd boys who are playing with
Kr�J)a do not have to learn by austerities or penances or yogic prac­
tice how to play with Him. They have passed all tests of regulative
principles in their previous lives, and as a result they are now elevated
to the position of direct association with Kr�J)a as His dear friends.
Their spontaneous attitude is called riigiinugii-bhakti.
Sri Riipa Gosvami has defined riigiiilUgii-bhakti as spontaneous at­
traction for something while completely absorbed in thoughts of it,
with an intense desire of love. Devotional service executed with such
feelings of spontaneous love is called riigiinugii-bhakti. Devotional
service under the heading of riigiinugii can be further divided into two
categories: one category is called sensuous attraction, and the other is
called relationship.
In this connection, there is a statement by Narada Muni to Yudhi�­

thira in the Seventh Canto, lst Chapter, 29th verse, of the Srimad­

Bhiigavatam. There Narada says, "My dear King, there are many devo­
tees who first become attracted to the Personality of Godhead for
purposes of sense gratification, from being envious of Him, out of
fear of Him, or from desiring to associate affectionately with Him.
Ultimately these attractions become freed from all material contami121

122

The Nectar of Devotion

nation, and gradually the wo'rshipcr develops spiritual love and

achieves that ultimate goal of life which is desired by the pure devo­

tee."

The gopis may be considered to be examples of spontaneous love

in sensual attraction. The gopis are young girls, and Krgta is a young

boy. Superficially it seems that the gopis are attracted to Kr��a on

grounds of sex. Similarly, King Kamsa was attracted to Kr��a because

of fearfulness. Kamsa was always fearful of Kr��a because it had been

foretold that his sister's son, Krgta, would kill him. Sisupala was also

always envious of Kr��a. And the descendants of King Yadu, due to

their family relationship with Kr��a, are always thinking of Him as

one of their members. All of these different kinds of devotees have a

spontaneous attraction for Kr��a, in different categories, and they
achieve the same desired goal of life.

The attraction of the gopis for Kr��a and the affection of the

members of the Y adu dynasty are both accepted as spontaneous, or

riigiinugii. The attraction of Kamsa to Kr��a in fearfulness and the

attraction of Sisupala in enviousness are not accepted as devotional

service, however, because their attitudes are not favorable. Devotional
service should be executed only in a favorable frame of mind. There­

fore, according to Sn,a Rupa Gosvami, such attractions are not con­

sidered to be in devotional service. Again, he analyzes the affection
of the Yadus: If it is on the platform of friendship, then it is spon­

taneous love, but if it is on the platform of regulative principles, then
it is not. And only when affection comes to the platform of spon­
taneous love is it counted in the category of pure devotional service.

There may be some difficulty in understanding that both the gopis

and Kamsa achieved the same goal, so this point should be clearly
understood, because the attitudes of Kamsa and Sisupala were dif­

ferent from that of the gopis. Although in all these cases the focus

is on the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and all of the devotees

are elevated to the spiritual world, there is still a distinction between

these two classes of souls. In the First Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam

it is said that the absolute truth is one, and He is manifested as im­

personal Brahman, Paramiitmii (supcrsoul), and Bhagaviin (the Su­
preme Personality of Godhead). Here is a spiritual distinction. AI-

�

Spontaneous Devotional Service

123

though Brahman, Paramiitmii and Bhagaviin arc the same and one

absolute truth, still devotees like Karilsa or Sisupala could attain only
to the Brahman effulgence. They could not have realization of

Paramiitmii or Bhagaviin. That is the distinction.

An analogy can be given with the sun globe and the sunshine: to

remain in the sunshine does not mean one has gone to the sun globe.

The temperature of the sun globe is different from the temperature

of the sunshine. One who has gone through the sunshine in jet planes

or in space ships has not necessarily gone to the sun globe. Although

the sunshine and the sun globe are actually one and the same, still

there is a distinction, for one is the energy and one is the energetic

source. The absolute truth and His bodily effulgence are in the same
way simultaneously one and different. Karilsa and Sisupala attained

to the absolute truth, but they were not allowed to enter into the
Goloka Vrndavana abode. lmpersonalists and the enemies of the

Lord are, because of attraction to God, allowed to enter into His
kingdom, but they are not allowed to enter into the V aiku':Jtha plan­

ets or the Goloka V rndavana planet of the Supreme Lord. To enter
the kingdom and to enter the king's palace are not the same thing.

Srila Riipa Gosvami" is trying here to describe the different achieve­

ments of the impersonalists and the personalists. Generally, those
who are impersonalists and inimical to the Supreme Personality of
Godhead get entrance only into the impersonal Brahman, when and

if they reach spiritual perfection. The impersonalist philosophers are

in one sense like the enemies of the Lord because the out-and-out

enemies of the Lord and the impersonalists are both allowed to enter
only into the impersonal effulgence of the brahma-jyoti. So it is to

be understood that they are of similar classification. And actually the
impersonalists are enemies of God because they cannot tolerate the

unparallelled opulence of the Lord. They try always to place them­

selves on the same level with the Lord. That is due to their envious
attitude. Sri" Caitanya Mahaprabhu has proclaimed the impersonalists

to be offenders of the Lord. The Lord is so kind, however, that even

though they are His enemies, they are still allowed to enter into the

spiritual kingdom and remain in the impersonal brahma-jyoti, the un­
differentiated light of the absolute_

The Nectar of Devotion

124

Sometimes an impersonalist may gradually elevate himself to the
personal conception of the Lord. The Bhagavad-gitii confirms this:
"After many births and deaths, he who is actually in knowledge
surrenders unto Me." By such surrender, an impersonalist can be ele­
vated to the Vaiku�tha-loka (spiritual planet) where, as a surrendered
soul, he attains bodily features like the Lord.
In the Brahmiirt!fa Purii[La it is stated: "Those who have achieved
liberation from material contamination, and those who are demons
and are killed by the Supreme Personality of Godhead, become ab­
sorbed in the Brahman concept of life and reside in the spiritual sky
of the brahma-jyoti." That spiritual sky is far beyond the material
sky, and it is confirmed also in the Bhagavad-gitii that beyond this
material sky there is another, eternal sky. The enemies and the im­
personalists may be allowed to enter into this Brahman effulgence,
but the devotees of Kr9�a are promoted all the way to the spiritual
planets. Because the pure devotees have developed their spontaneous
love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, they are allowed to
enter into the spiritual planets to enj oy spiritual bliss in association
with the Supreme Personality of Godhead.
In

the

Tenth

Canto,

87th

Chapter,

19th verse, of

Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, the Vedas personified address the Lord in this way:
"My dear Lord, yogis meditate upon Your localized features, and
thus they achieve the spiritual perfection of being merged in the im­
personal brahma-jyoti. Persons who treat You as an enemy achieve
the same perfection without meditating. The gopis, who are em­
braced by Your serpentine hands and who have such lusty attitudes,
also achieve the same perfection. And, as far as we ar� concerned,

being different demigods in charge of the different parts of Vedic
knowledge, we are always following in the footsteps of the gopis.
Thus we hope to attain the same perfection." By "the same perfec­
tion" we must always remember the example of the sun and the
sunshine. Those who are impersonalists can merge into the sunshine­
like brahma-jyoti, whereas those who are in love with the Supreme
Person enter into the supreme abode of the Lord, Goloka V rndavana.
The "lusty attitude" of the gopis does not refer to any sort of sex

indulgence. Srila Riipa Gosvami explains that this "lusty desire" re-

Spontaneous Devotional Service

125

fers to the devotee's particular attitude of association with Kr�!la.
Every devotee in his perfectional stage has a spontaneous attraction
to the Lord. This attraction is sometimes called the "lusty desire" of
the devotee. The lust is the devotee's excessive desire to serve the
Lord in a particular capacity. Such desire may seem to be a desire for
enjoying the Lord, but actually the endeavor is to serve the Lord in
that capacity. For example, a devotee may be desiring to associate
with the Personality of Godhead as His cowherd friend. He will want
to serve the Lord by assisting Him in controlling the cows in the pas­
turing ground. This may appear to be a desire to enjoy the company
of the Lord, but actually it is spontaneous love, serving Him by
assisting in managing the transcendental cows.
This extreme desire to serve the Lord is manifest in the transcen­
dental land of Braja. And it is specifically manifested amongst the
gopis. The gopis' love for Kr�!la is so elevated that for our under­
standing it is sometimes explained as being "lusty desire."

The author of Sri Caitanya-caritiimrta, Kaviraja Kr�!ladas, has ex­

plained the distinction between lusty desire and the service attitude
in this statement: "Lusty desire refers to the desire to gratify one's
personal senses, and transcendental desire refers to the desire for
serving the senses of the Lord." In the material world there is no
such thing as a lover wanting to please the senses of his beloved.
Actually, in the material world, everyone wants mainly to gratify his
own personal senses. The gopis, however, wanted nothing at all but
to gratify the senses of the Lord, and there is no instance of this in
the material world. Therefore the gopis' ecstatic love for Kr�!la is
sometimes described by scholars as being like the "lusty desire" of
the material world, but actually this should not be taken as a literal
fact. It is simply a way of trying to understand the transcendental
situation.
Great devotees up to the standard of Uddhava are very dear
friends of the Lord, and they desire to follow in the footsteps of the
gopis. So the gopis' love for Kr�!la is certainly not material lusty de­
sire. Otherwise, how could Uddhava aspire to follow in their foot­
steps? Another instance is Lord Caitanya Himself. After accepting
the sannyiisa order of life, He was very, very strict about avoiding

126

The Nectar of Devotion

association with women, but still He taught that there is no better

method of worshiping Kr��a than that conceived by the gopis. Thus
the gopis' method of worshiping the Lord, as if impelled by lusty

desire, was praised very highly even by Sri Caitanya Mahaprabhu.
This very fact means that although the attraction of the gopis for

Kr��a appears to be lusty, it is not in the least bit material. Unless
one is fully situated in the transcendental position, it is very difficult
to understand the relationship of the gopis with Kr��a. But because

it appears to be just like ordinary dealings of young boys and girls, it
is sometimes misinterpreted to be like the ordinary sex of this ma­

terial world. Unfortunately, persons who cannot understand the tran­

scendental nature of the love affairs of the gopis and Kr��a take it

for granted that Kr��a 's love affairs with the gopis are mundane
transactions, and therefore they sometimes indulge in painting licen­

tious pictures in some modernistic style.

On the other hand, the lusty desire of Kubja is described by

learned scholars as being "almost lusty desire." Kubja was a hunch­

back woman who also wanted Kr��a with a great ecstatic love. But
her desire for Kr��a was almost mundane, and so her love cannot be
compared with the love of the gopis. Her loving affection for Kr��a

is called kiima-priiyii, or almost like the gopis' love for Krwa.

16 I Varieties of Love for Krsna
•

•

•

Parental Relationship
In the attitude of the denizens of Vrndavana, such as Nanda Maha­
raj and Mother Y asoda, is to be found the ideal transcendental con­
cept of becoming the father and mother of Kr�!la, the original Per­
sonality of Godhead. Factually, no one can become the father or
mother of Krwa; but a devotee's possession of such transcendental
feelings is called love of Kr�!la in parental relationship. The Vr�¢s
(Kr�!la's relatives at Dvaraka) also felt like that. So spontaneous love
of Kr9!1a in the parental relationship is found both amongst those
denizens of Dvaraka who belonged to the dynasty of V r�!li, as well
as amongst the inhabitants of Vrndavana.
Spontaneous love of Kr�!la as exhibited by the Vr�!lis and the
denizens of Vrndavana is eternally existing in them. In the stage of
devotional service where regulative principles are followed, there is
no necessity of discussing this love, for it must develop of itself at a
more advanced stage.
Persons desiring to follow in the footsteps of such eternal devotees
of the Lord as the Vr�!lis and Vrndavana denizens are called riigiinugii
devotees, which means that they are trying to attain to the perfection
of those devotees. These riigiinugii devotees do not follow the regula­
tive principles of devotional service very strictly, but by spontaneous
nature they become attracted to some of the eternal devotees such as
Nanda or Yaso da, and they try to follow in their footsteps spon­
taneously. There is a gradual development of the ambition to become
like a particular devotee, and this activity is called riigiinugii.

127

128

The Nectar of Devotion

We must always remember, however, that such eagerness to follow
in the footsteps of the denizens of Braja (Vrndavana) is not possible
unless one is freed from material contamination. In following the
regulative principles of devotional service, there is a stage which is
called anartha-nivrtti, which means the disappearance of all material
contamination.

Sometimes it is found that someone is imitating

such devotional love, but factually he is not freed from anarthas, or
unwanted habits. It has been seen that a so-called devotee proclaims
himself a follower of Nanda, Yasoda or the gopis, while at the same
time his abominable attraction for mundane sex life is visible. Such a
manifestation of divine love is mere imitation and has no value. When
one is actually spontaneously attracted to the loving principles of the
gopis, there will be found no trace of any mundane contamination

in his character.
Therefore, in the beginning, everyone should strictly follow the
regulat ive principl es of devotional service, a ccording to the injunc­

tions of the scriptures and the spiritual master. Only after the stage of
liberation from material contamination can one actually aspire to follow in the footsteps of the devotees in Vrndavana.

.
It is said by Sri Riipa Gosvami: "When one is actually liberated

from material contamination, he can always remember an eternal
devotee in Vrndavana in order to love Kr��a in the same capacity.
And developing such an aptitude, one will always live in Vrndavana,
even within his mind." The purport is that, if it is possible, one should
go and physically be present at Braj abhiimi, Vrndavana, and be en­
gaged always in the service of the Lord, following the devotees in
Braj adhama, the spiritual realm of Braj a. If it is not possible, how­
ever, to be physically present at Vrndavana, one can meditate any­
where upon living in that situation. Wherever he may be, one must
always think about life in Braj adhama

and about following in the

footsteps of a particular devotee in the service of the Lord.

A devotee who is actually advanced in Kr��a consciousness, who is
constantly engaged in devotional service, should not manifest himself
even though he has attained perfection. The idea is that he should
always continue to act as a neophyte devotee as long as his material
body is there. Activities in devotional service under regulative princi-

Varieties of Love for Knr:a

129

ples must be followed even by the pure devotee. But when he realizes

his actual position in relationship with the Lord, he can, along with
the discharging of regulative service, think within himself of the Lord,

under the guidance of a particular associate of the Lord, and develop
his transcendental sentiments in following that associate.

In this connection, we should be careful about the so-called

siddha-prarwi. The siddha-prarwi process is followed by a class of

men who are not very authorized and who have manufactured their
own way of devotional service. They imagine that they have become
associates of the Lord simply by thinking of themselves like that.

This external behavior is not at all according to the regulative princi­

ples. The so-called siddha-prarai process is followed by the pralqta

sahajiyii, a pseudo-sect of so-called Vai§ravas. In the opinion of Rilpa
Gosvami, such activities are simply disturbances to the standard way

of devotional service.

Sri Rilpa Gosvami says that learned iiciiryas recommended that we

follow the regulative principles even after the development of spon­

taneous love for Kr�-!la. According to the regulative principles, there

are nine departmental activities, as described above, and one should

specifically engage himself in the type of devotional service for which
he has a natural aptitude. For example, one person may have a par­

ticular interest in hearing, another may have a particular interest in
chanting, and another may have a particular interest in serving in the

temple. So these, or any of the other six different types of devo­

tional service (remembering, serving, praying, engaging in some par­

ticular service, being in a friendly relationship or offering everything

in one's possession) should pe executed in full earnestness. In this

way everyone should act according to his particular taste .

Conjugal Love
Devotional service following in the footsteps of the gopis of

V rndavana or the queerts at Dvaraka is called devotional service in

conjugal love. This devotional service in conjugal love can be divided

into two categories. One is indirect conjugal love, the other direct. In

�

130

The Nectar of Devotion

both of these categories one has to follow the particular gopi who is
engaged in such service in Goloka Vrndavana. To be directly attached
to the Supreme Personality of Godhead in conjugal love is technically
called keli. This keli performance means to directly join with the Su·
preme Personality of Godhead. There are other devotees who do not
wish direct contact with the Supreme Person, but who relish the con­
jugal love affairs of the Lord with the gopis. Such devotees enjoy
simply by hearing of the activities of the Lord with the gopis.
This development of conjugal love can only be possible only with
those who are already engaged in following the regulative principles
of devotional service, specifically in the worship of Radha and Krwa
in the temple. Such devotees gradually develop a spontaneous love
for the Deity, and by hearing of the Lord's exchange of loving af­
fairs with the gopis, they gradually become attracted to these pas­
times. After this spontaneous attraction becomes highly developed,
the devotee is placed in either of the above-mentioned categories.
This development of conjugal love for Kr�l).a is not manifested in
women only. The material body has nothing to do with spiritual
loving affairs. A woman may develop an attitude for becoming a
friend of Kr�l).a, and, similarly, a man may develop the feature of
becoming a gopi in Vrndavana. How a devotee in the form of a man
can desire to become a gopi is stated in the Padma Puriir-a as follows:
"In days gone by there were many sages in Dal).9akaral).ya. Dal).9a­
karal).ya is the name of the forest where Lord Ramacandra lived after
being banished by his father for fourteen years. At that time there
were many advanced sages who were captivated by the beauty of
Lord Ramacandra and who desired to become women in order to
embrace the Lord. Later on these sages appeared in Goloka Vrnda­
vana when Kr�l).a advented Himself there, and they were born as

gopis or girl friends of Krwa. In this way they attained the perfection
of spiritual life."
The story of the sages of Dal).9akaral).ya can be explained as fol­
lows: When Lord Ramacandra was residing in Dal).9akaral).ya, the
sages who were engaged in devotional service there became attracted
by His beauty and immediately thought of the gopis at Vrndavana
who enjoyed conjugal loving affection with Kr�J).a. In this instance it

Varieties of Love for Kr�r:a

131

is clear that the sages of Da�9akara�ya desired conjugal love in the
manner of the gopis, although they were well aware of the Supreme
Lord as both Kr��a and Lord Ramacandra. They knew that Rama­
candra was an ideal king and could not accept more than one wife;
but Lord Krwa, being the full-fledged Personality of Godhead, could
fulfill the desires of all of them in Vrndavana. These sages also con­
cluded that the form of Lord Kr��a is more attractive than that of
Lord Ramacandra, and so they prayed to become gopis in their fu­
ture lives to be associated with Kr��a. Lord Ramacandra remained
silent, and His silence shows that He accepted the prayers of the
sages. Thus they were blest by Lord Ramacandra to have association
with Lord Kr��a in their future lives. As a result of this benediction,
they all took birth as women in the wombs of gopis at Gokula, and,
as they had desired in their previous lives, they enjoyed the company
of Lord Kr��a, who was present at that time in Gokula V rndavana.
The perfection of their human form of life was thus achieved by
their generating a transcendental sentiment to share conjugal love
with Lord Krsna.
.

.

.

.

Conjugal love is divided into two classifications-namely, conjugal
love as husband and wife and conjugal love as lover and beloved. One
who develops conjugal love for Kr��a as a wife is promoted to
Dvaraka, where the devotee becomes the queen of the Lord. Those
who develop conjugal love for Kr��a as a lover are promoted to Go­
loka Vrndavana, to associate with the gopis and enjoy loving affairs
with Kr��a there. We should note carefully, however, that this con­
jugal love for Kr��a, either as gopi or queen, is not limited only to
women. Even men can develop such sentiments, ilS was evidenced by
the sages of Da�9akara�ya. If someone simply desires conjugal love
but does not follow in the footsteps of the gopis, he is promoted to
association with the Lord at Dvaraka.
In the Mahii-kurma Purii[La it is stated: "Great sages who were the
sons of fire gods rigidly followed the regulative principles in their de­
sire to have conjugal love for Kr�!la. As such, in their next lives they
were able to associate with the Lord, the origin of all creation, who
is known as Vasudeva, or Kr�!la. Every one of them got Him as their
husband."

132

The Nectar of Devotion

Parenthood or Friendship
Devotees who are attracted to Kr��a as parents or as friends
should follow in the footsteps of Nanda Maharaj or Subala, respec­
tively. Nanda Maharaj is the foster father of Kr��a, and out of all of
the friends of Kr��a, Subala is the most intimate in Brajabhiimi.
In the development of becoming either the father or friend of the
Lord, there are two varieties. One method is that one may try to
become the father of the Lord directly, and the other is that one
may follow Nanda Maharaj and cherish the ideal of being Kr��a's
father. Out of these two, the attempt to directly become the father
of Kr�!la is not recommended. Such a development can become
polluted with miiyiiviida (impersonal) philosophy. The miiyiiviidis or
monists think that they themselves are Kr�!la, and if one thinks that
he himself has become Nanda Maharaj, then his parental love will be­
come contaminated with the miiyiiviida philosophy. The miiyiiviida
philosophical way of thinking is offensive, and no offender can enter
into the kingdom of God to associate with Kr��a.

·

In the Skanda Puriir.a there is a story of an old man residing in
Hastinapur, capital of the kingdom of the Pa��us, who desired Kr��a
as

his beloved son. This old man was instructed by Narada to follow

in the footsteps of Nanda Maharaj, and thus success was achieved by
him.
There is a statement in the Niiriiyar.a-vyilha-stava prayers that per­
sons who are always engaged in thinking of the Lord as their hus­
band, friend, father or well-wisher are always worshipable by every­
one. This spontaneous love for Kr��a can only be developed by the
special mercy of Kr��a or His pure devotee. This process of devo­
tional service is sometimes called pu§ti-miirga. Pu§ti means nourishing
and miirga means path. Such development of sentiment nourishes de­
votional service to the highest standard. Thus it is called the path of
nourishment, or pu§ti-miirga. The V allabha-sampradiiya, which be­
longs to the Vi�!lu-svami sect of Vai§r.ava religion, worships Kr��a in
this pu§ti-miirga. Generally devotees in Gujerat worship Bala-Kr��a,
under this heading of pu§ti-miirga.

17 I Ecstatic Love

By the process of executing regulated devotional service, one is ac­
tually elevated onto the transcendental stage, beyond the material
modes of nature. At that time one's heart becomes illuminated like
the sun. The sun is far above the planetary systems, and there is no
possibility of its being covered by any kind of cloud; similarly, when
a devotee is purified like the sun, from his pure heart there is a dif­
fusion of ecstatic love which is more glorious than the sunshine. Only
at that time is the attachment to Kr�!la perfect. Spontaneously, the
devotee becomes eager to serve the Lord in his ecstatic love. At this
stage the devotee is on the platform of uttama adhikiiri, perfect devo­

tion. Such a devotee has no agi tation from material affections and is
only interested in the service of Radha and Kr�!J.a.
To clarify, in the previous chapters, the symptoms of devotional
service were explained along with instructions as to how they can be
executed with our present senses, gradually rising to the platform of
ecstasy of spontaneous love. And the two kinds of devotional service
-namely devotional service through regulative principles and through
spontaneous love-were discussed. Within the stage of the regulative
principles of devotional service there are two divisions-namely execu­
tive and effective. This effective portion of devotional service is
called bhiiva, or ecstasy. In this connection, there is a statement in
the Tantras that ecstasy is the first symptom of pure love for the
Personality of Godhead, and in that stage one is sometimes found
shedding tears or shivering. Not always are these symptoms manifest,
but occasionally. When King Ambar'i�a was put into difficulty by
Durvasa, he began to think of the lotus feet of the Lord, and thus
133

134

The Nectar of Devotion

there were some changes in his body, and tears were falling from his
eyes. These symptoms are activities of ecstasy. They are visible in the
shivering of the body and the shedding of tears. After the outward
appearance of these ecstatic symptoms, they stay within the mind,

and continuation of the ecstasy is called samiidhi. This stage of ap­
preciation becomes the cause of future exchanges of loving affairs
with Kr�tta.
Elevation to this stage of ecstasy can be possible in two ways. One
way is constant association with pure devotees. The other way is by
the special mercy of Kr�tta, or by the mercy of a pure devotee of
Kr�tta. Elevation to the ecstatic stage of life is generally attained
through association with pure devotees, while elevation to that stage
by the special mercy of Kr�tta or His devotee is very rare. The pur­
port is that one should execute devotional service rigidly in the asso­
ciation of devotees so that there will be certainty in raising oneself
to that ecstatic position. In special cases, of course, there is special
favor from Kr�tta, and although we should always expect that, we
should not sit idly and simply wait for Kr�tta's special mercy; the
regular duties must be performed. It is just as when, sometimes, it
is found that a person who never attended school or college may be
recognized as a great scholar, or an honorary degree from great uni­
versities may be offered to him. But this does not mean that one
should avoid school and expect to automatically receive an honorary
degree from some university. Similarly, one should devoutly execute
the regulative principles of devotional service and at the same time
hope for Kr�tta's favor or for His devotee's favor.
An example of rising to the stage of ecstatic love by executing the
regulative principles of devotional service is given in the life story of
Narada, which is described to Vyasadeva in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam.

Narada tells there of his previous life and how he developed to the
stage of ecstatic love. He was engaged in the service of great devotees
and used to hear their talks and songs. Because he had the oppor­
tunity to hear these pastimes and songs of Kr�tta from the mouths of
pure devotees, he became very attracted within his heart. Because he
had become so eager to hear these topics, he gradually developed
within himself an ecstatic love for Kr�tta. This ecstatic love is prior

Ecstatic Love

135

to the pure love of Kr�!!a, because in the next verse Narada confirms
that by, the gradual process of hearing from the great sages he de­
veloped love of Godhead_ In that connection, Narada continues to say
in the First Canto, 5th Chapter, 28th verse, of the Bhiigavatam: "Fir::;t J

passed my days in the association of the great sages during the rainy
autumn season. Every morning and evening I heard them while they
were singing and chanting the Hare K[§!W mantra, and thus gradually
my heart became purified. As soon as I heard them with great atten­
tion, the influence of the modes of material ignorance and passion
disappeared, and I became firmly fixed in devotional service to the
Lord."
These are practical examples of how one can develop to the stage
of ecstatic love simply by the association of pure devotees. It is essen­
tial, therefore, that one constantly associate with pure devotees who

are engaged morning and evening in chanting the Hare K[§[W mantra.

In this way one will get the chance to purify his heart and develop
this ecstatic pure love for Kr�!la.
This statement is also confirmed in the Third Canto, 25th Chapter,

22nd verse, of the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, where Lord Kapila says, "My
dear Mother, when a person is actually in association with pure devo­
tees, the sublime potency of My devotional service can be experi­

enced." In other words, when a pure devotee speaks, his words act
upon the hearts of the audience. What is the secret of hearing and
chanting? A professional speaker cannot impress transcendental ec­
stasy within the hearts of the listeners. However, when a realized
soul who is engaged in the service of the Lord is speaking, he has the
potency to inject spiritual life within the audience. One should, there­
fore, seek the association of such pure unalloyed devotees, and by
such association and service a neophyte devotee will certainly develop
attachment, love and devotion for the Supreme Personality of God­
head.

In the Padma Purii[ta there is the story of a neophyte devotee who,

in order to raise himself to the ecstatic platform, danced all night to
invoke the Lord's grace upon him.
Sometimes, however, it is found that without undergoing any de­
votional process, one all of

a

sudden develops devotion for Lord

136

The Nectar of Devotion

Kr�!J.a. This sudden development of the devotional attitude in a per·

son must be understood as a special mercy of Kr�!la or of His devo­
tee.

This apparently accidental development of ecstatic feelings

through the causeless mercy of Kr�!la can be divided into three
groups: simply by speaking, simply by glancing and simply by good

wishes.

In the Niiradiya Puriirw there is a statement about development of

ecstatic love simply by speaking. Lord Kr�!la said to Narada, "0 best

of the briihma[laS, I wish that you may develop unalloyed devotional
service to Me, which is full of transcendental bliss and all auspicious­

ness."

In the Skanda Purii[la there is a statement about developing ec­

static love towards Krwa simply by glancing. It is stated there:

"When the inhabitants of J angala Province saw the Personality of

Godhead, Kr�!J.a, they were so stricken with feeling that they could

not withdraw their glance from Him."

As far as heartfelt wishes are concerned, there is a statement in the

Suka-samhitii where Narada tells Srila Vyasadeva, "You have a son

who is the greatest devotee of the Personality of Godhead, and I can

observe that without any following of the regulative principles of de­

votional service, he is already enriched with many of the symptoms
achieved by the execution of devotional service after many, many

births."

As for ecstatic love of Kr�!J.a, there is a statement in the Seventh

Canto, 4th Chapter, 26th verse, of Srimad-Bhiigavatam in which

Narada addresses King Yudhi�thira: "My dear King, it is very difficult

to describe the character of PrahHida. He developed a natural attrac­

tion for Kr�!J.a, and whatever I can explain about his character will
simply be an arrangement of words; his actual character is impossible

to describe." This means Narada himself admitted that the natural

development of Prahlada 's ecstatic love was by the grace of Lord
Kr�!J.a.

This natural attraction for Kr�!la on the part of Prahlada was de­

veloped simply by the mercy of Narada. When Prahlada Maharaj was
within the womb of his mother, she was being sympathetically in­

structed by Narada about the science of devotional service, and at the

Ecstatic Love

137

same time Narada was wishing that the child within the womb could
also take advantage of the instructions. Because Narada, an authorized
devotee and great associate of the Personality of Godhead, was de­
siring auspiciousness for Prahlada Maharaj, he developed all the char­
acteristics of a high-grade devotee. This is called natural attraction. It
is caused by the special grace of the Personality of Godhead or by the
special grace of a great devotee like Narada.

There is a statement in the Skanda Puriirta wherein Patvata Muni

tells Narada: "My dear Narada, of all saintly persons you are so great
and glorious that simply by your good wishes a lowborn hunter also
has become a great, elevated devotee of Lord Kr��a."
This ecstatic love for Kr��a can be divided into five divisions,

which will be described by Sri Riipa Gosvami later on.

18 I Character
of One in Ecstatic Love

Riipa Gosvami next describes the characteristics of a person who
has actually developed his ecstatic love for Kr�tJ.a. The characteristics
are as follows:

l) He is always anxious to utilize his time in the devotional ser­
vice of the Lord. He does not like to be idle. He wants service always,
twenty-four hours a day without deviation.

2) He is always reserved and perseverant.
3) He is always detached from all material attraction.
4) He does not long for any material respect in return for his·
activities.

5) He is always certain that Kr�tJ.a will bestow His mercy upon
Him.

6) He is always very eager to serve the Lord faithfully.
7) He is very much attached to the chanting of the holy names of
the Lord.

8) He is always eager to describe the transcendental qualities of
the Lord.

9) He is very pleased to live in a place where the Lord's pastimes
are performed, e.g., Mathura, Vrndavana, or Dvaraka.

Utilization of Time
An unalloyed devotee who has developed ecstatic love for Kr�tJ.a is
always engaging his words in reciting prayers to the Lord. Within the
mind he is always thinking of Kr��a, and with his body he is either

138

Character of One in Ecstatic Love

139

offering obeisances by bowing down before the Deity or is engaging
in some other service. During these ecstatic activities he sometimes
sheds tears. In this way his whole life is engaged in the service of the
Lord, with not a moment wasted on any other engagement.

Perseverance
When a person is undisturbed even in the presence of various
causes of disturbance, he is called reserved and perseverant. An ex­
ample of this perseverance and reservation is found in the behavior of
King Parik�it, as described in the First Canto, 19th Chapter, 13th

verse,of the Srimad-Bhagavatam. The King says there to all the sages
present before him at the time of his death, "My dear brahmar;ws, you
should always accept me as your surrendered servant. I have come to
the bank of the Ganges just to devote my heart and soul unto the
lotus feet of Lord Kr�!J.a. So please bless me, that Mother Ganges may
also be pleased with me. Let the curse of the brahmar;w 's son fall
upon me-l do not mind. I only request that at the last moment of
my life all of you will kindly chant the holy name of Vi�!J.U, so that I
may realize His transcendental qualities."
This example of Maharaj Parik�it's behavior, his remaining patient
even at the last point of his life, his undisturbed condition of mind, is
an example of reservation. This is one of the characteristics of a devo­
tee who has developed ecstatic love for Kr�!J.a.

Detachment
The senses are always desiring sense enjoyment, but when a devo­
tee develops transcendental love for Kn;!la his senses are _no longer
attracted by material desires. This state of mind is called detach­

ment. There is a nice example of this detachment in connection with
the character of King Bharata. In the Fifth Canto, 14th Chapter, 43rd

verse, of Srimad-Bhagavatam it is stated: "Emperor Bharata was so

attracted by the beauty of the lotus feet of Kr�!la that even in his

140

The Nectar of Devotion

youthful life he gave up all kinds of attachments to family, children,
friends, kingdom, etc., as though they were untouchable stools."
Emperor Bharata is a typical example of detachment. He had ev­
erything enjoyable in the material world, but he left it. This means
that detachment does not mean artificially keeping oneself aloof and
apart from the allurements of attachment. Even in the presence of
such allurements, if one can remain unattracted by material attach­
ments, that is called detachment. In the beginning, of course, a neo­
phyte devotee must try to keep himself apart from all kinds of al­
luring attachments, but the real position of a mature devotee is that
even in the presence of all allurements, he is not at all attracted. This
is the actual criterion of detachment.

PridelPss nPss
When a devotee, in spite of possessing all the qualities of pure
realization, is not proud of his position, that is called pridelessness.
In the Padma PuriiT;w it is stated that King Bhagiratha was the emper­
or above all other kings, yet he developed such ecstatic love for Krwa
that he became a mendicant and went out begging even to the homes
of his political enemies and untouchables. He was so humble that he
respectfully bowed down before them.
There are many similar instances in the history of India. Even very
recently, about 200 years ago or less, one big landlord known as
Lalababu, a Calcutta landholder, became a Vaisnava and lived in
.

.

Vrndavana. He was also begging from door to door, even at the homes
of his political enemies. Begging involves being ready to be insulted
by persons at whose home one has come. That is natural. But one has
to tolerate such insults for the sake� of Krsna.
The devotee of Krsna
.
.

.

.

.

.

can accept any position in the service of Kr�!la.

Great HopP

The strong conviction that one will certainly receive the favor of

Character of One in Ecstatic Love

141

the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called in Sanskrit iisii-bandha.
Asii-bandha means to continue to think, "Because I'm trying my best
to follow the routine principles of devotional service, I am sure that I
will go back to Godhead, back to home."
In this connection, one prayer by Riipa Gosvami is sufficient to
exemplify this hopefulness. He says, "I have no love for Kr��a nor for
the causes of developing love of Kr��a-namely, hearing and chanting.
And the process of bhakti-yoga, by which one is always thinking of
Kr��a and fixing His lotus feet in the heart, is also lacking in me. As
far as philosophical knowledge or pious words are concerned, I don't
see any opportunity for me to execute such activities. But above all, I
am not even born of a nice family. Therefore I must simply pray
to You, Gopi-jana-vallabha [Kr��a, maintainer and beloved of the

gopis]. I simply wish and hope that some way or other I may be able
to approach Your lotus feet, and this hope is giving me pain, because
I think myself quite incompetant to approach that transcendental
goal of life." The purport is that under this heading,of iisii-bandha,
one should continue to hope against hope that some way or other he
will be able to approach the lotus feet of the Supreme Lord.

Eagerness for Achieving the Desired Success

When one is sufficiently eager to achieve success in devotional ser­
vice, that is called samutkarthii. This means complete eagerness. Ac­
tually this eagerness is the price for achieving success in Kr��a con­
sciousness. Everything has some value, and one has to pay the value
before obtaining or possessing it. It is stated in the Vedic literature
that to purchase the most valuable thing, Kr��a consciousness, one
has to develop intense eagerness for achieving success. This intense
eagerness is very nicely expressed by Bilvamangala Thakur in his
book K[§T}a-harT}iimrta. He says, "I am eagerly waiting to see that boy
of Vrndavana whose bodily beauty is captivating the whole universe,
whose eyes are always bounded by black eyebrows and expanded like
lotus petals, who is always eagerly glancing over His devotees and
therefore moving slightly here and there. His eyes are always moist,

142

The Nectar of Devotion

and His lips are colored like copper, and through those lips there

comes a sound vibration which drives one madder. than a mad ele­
phant. I want so much to see Him at Vrndavana!"

In the same Karr-iimrta there is another statement about the chant­

ing of Radhara!li It is said by one of the associates of Radhara!li: "0

Lord Govinda, the girl who is daughter of King V r�abhanu is now

shedding tears, and She is anxiously chanting Your holy name­
Kr�!la! Kr�!la!"

This attachment for chanting the glories of the Lord is also stated

in the Karr-amrta as follows: "What shall I do for Kr�!la, who is pleas­

ing beyond all pleasurable conceptions, and who is naughtier than all
restless boys? The idea of Kr�!la's beautiful activities is attracting my

heart, and I do not know what I can do!"

Attraction for Living in a Place Where K[§[la Has His Pastimes

In the book Padyiivali by Riipa Gosvami there is the following

statement about Vrndavana: "In this place the son of Maharaj Nanda

used to live with His father, who was king of all cowherd men. In

this place Lord Kr�!la broke the cart in which the Sakatasura demon

was concealed. At this place Damodara, who can cut the knot of our
material existence, was tied up by His mother Y asoda."

A pure devotee of Lord Kr�!la resides in the district of Mathura or

Vrndavana and visits all the places where Kr�!la's pastimes were per­

formed. At these sacred places Kr�!la displayed His childhood activi­

ties with the cowherd boys and Mother Y asoda. The system of cir­

cumambulating all these places is still current among devotees of
Lord Kr�!la, and those coming to Mathura and Vrndavana always feel

transcendental pleasure. Actually, if someone goes to Vrndavana, he

will immediately feel separation from Kr�!la, who performed such
nice activities when He was present there.

Such attraction for remembering Kr�!la's activities is known as at­

tachment for Kr�!la. There are impersonalist philosophers and mys­

tics, however, who by a show of devotional service want ultimately

Character of One in Ecstatic Love

143

to merge into the existence of the Supreme Lord. They sometimes
try to imitate a pure devotee's sentiment for visiting the holy places
where Kr��a had His pastimes, but they simply have a view for salva­
tion, and so their activities cannot be considered attachment.
It is said by Rupa Gosvami that the attachment exhibited by pure
devotees for Kr��a cannot possibly be perfected in the heart of
fruitive workers (karmis) or mental speculators because such attach­
ment in pure Kr�!la consciousness is very rare and not possible to
achieve even for many liberated persons. As is stated in the Bhagavad­
gitii, liberation from material contamination is the stage at which de­
votional service can be achieved. For a person who simply wants to
have liberation and to merge into the impersonal brahma-jyoti, it is
not possible to acquire attachment to Kr�!la. This attachment is very
confidentially kept by Kr��a and is only bestowed upon pure devo­
tees. Even ordinary devotees cannot have such pure attachment for
Krwa. Therefore, how is it possible for success t-o be achieved by per­
sons whose hearts are contaminated by the actions and reactions of
fruitive activities and who are entangled by various types of mental
speculation?
There are many so-called devotees who artificially think of Kr��a's
pastimes, which are known as a§ta-kiilika-lilii. Sometimes one may arti­
ficially imitate these, pretending that Kr��a is talking with him in the
form of a boy, or else one may pretend that Radhara!J.i and Kr�!la
both have come to him and are talking with him. Such characteristics
are sometimes exhibited by the impersonalist class of men, and they
may captivate some innocent persons who have no knowledge in the
science of devotional service. However, as soon as an experienced devo­
tee sees all of these caricatures, he can immediately evaluate such
rascaldom. If such a pretender is sometimes seen possessing imitative
attachment to Kr��a, that will not be accepted as real attachment.
It may be said, however, that such attachment is like giving a future
hope to the pretender, so that he may eventually rise onto the actual
platform of pure devotional service.
This imitative attachment can be divided into two headings-name­
ly, shadow attachment and para (transcendental) attachment. If
someone, without undergoing the regulative principles of devotional

144

The Nectar of Devotion

service or without being guided by a bona fide spiritual master, shows
such imitative attachment, it is called shadow attachment. Some­
times it is found that a person actually attached to material enj oy­
ment or salvation has the good fortune to associate with pure devo­
tees while they are engaged in chanting the holy name of the Lord.

By the good grace of the Lord one may also cooperate and j oin in the
chanting. At that time, simply by the association of such pure devo­
tees, the moonlike rays from their hearts reflect on him, and by the

influence of the pure devotees he may show some likeness of attach­
ment caused by inquisitiveness, but this is very flickering. And, if by
the manifestation of such shadow attachment one feels the disap­
pearance of all m aterial pangs, then it i s called para attachment;

Such shadow attachment or para attachment can develop by
associating with a pure devotee or by visiting holy places like V rn­
davana or Mathura; or if an ordinary man develops such attachment
for Kr��a and fortunately performs devotional activities in the asso­
ciation of pure devotees, he can also rise up to the platform of pure
devotional service. The conclusion is that transcendental attachment
is so powerful that even if such attachment is seen manifested in
some common man, by the association of a pure devotee it can bring
one to the perfectional stage. But such attachment for Kr��a cannot
be invoked in a person without his being sufficiently blessed by the
association of pure devotees.
As attachment can be invoked by the association of pure devotees,
so attachment can also be extinguished by committing offenses at
the lotus feet of pure devotees. To be more clear, by the association
of pure devotees attachment for Kr��a can be aroused, but if one
commits offenses at the lotus feet of a devotee, his shadow attach­
ment or para attachment can be extinguished. This extinguishing is
like the waning moon, which gradually decreases and at last becomes
darkness. One should therefore be very careful while associating with
pure devotees to guard against committing an offense at their lotus
feet.
Transcendental attachment, either shadow or para, can be nullified
by different degrees of offenses at the lotus feet of pure devotees. If

Character of One in Ecstatic Love

145

the offense is very serious, then one's attachment becomes almost
nil, and if the offense is not very serious, one's attachment can be­
come second-class or third-class.
If someone becomes attached to the principles of salvation or to
merging into the existence of the brahma-jyoti, his ecstasies gradually
diminish into shadow and para attachment

or else transform into

the principles of ahangrahopiisanii. This ahangrahopiisanii describes
a living entity when he begins· spiritual realization by identifying him­
self with the Supreme Lord. This state of self realization is technically
known as monism. The monist thinks himself one with the Supreme
Lord. Thus, without differentiating between himself and the Supreme
Lord, it is his view that by worshiping himself he is worshiping the
supreme whole.
Sometimes it is found that a neophyte is taking part in chanting
and dancing very enthusiastically, but within himself he is under the
impression that he has become one with the supreme whole. This
conception of monism is completely different from pure transcen­
dental devotional service. If, however, it is seen that a person has
developed a high standard of devotion without having undergone
even the regulative principles, it is to be understood that his status of
devotional service was achieved in a former life. For some.reason or
another it had been temporarily stopped, most probably by commit­
ting an offense at the lotus feet of a devotee. Now, with a good sec­
ond chance, it has again begun to develop. The conclusion is that
steady progress in devotional service can be attained only in the asso­
ciation of pure devotees.
If one can gradually advance his status in devotional service, it is
to be understood that it is due to the causeless mercy of Krwa Him­
self. If a person is completely detached from material enjoyment and
has developed pure ecstatic devotion, even if he is sometimes acci­
dentally found not to be living up to the standard of devotional ser­
vice, one should not be envious of him. It is confirmed also in the

Bhagavad-gitii that a devotee who has unflinching faith in and de­
votion to the Lord, even if he is sometimes found to be accidentally
deviated from pure devotional characteristics, should still be counted
amongst the pure. Unflinching faith in devotional service, in Lord

146

The Nectar of Devotion

Kr�!la and in the spiritual master makes one highly elevated in the
activities of devotional service.
In the Nrsimha Puriir-a it is stated: "If a person has completely en­
gaged his mind, body and activities in the service of the Supreme
Godhead, and externally he is found to be engaged in some abomina­
ble activities, these abominable activities will surely be very quickly
vanquished by the influence of his staunch devotional force." The
example is given that on the full moon there are some spots which
may appear to be pockmarks. Still, the illumination spread by the
full moon cannot be checked. Similarly, a little fault in the midst of
volumes of devotional service is not at all to be counted as fault. At­
tachment for Krwa is transcendental bliss. Amidst unlimited vol­
umes of transcendental bliss, a spot of some material defect cannot
act in any way.

\:

19 I Devotional Service
in Love of God

When one's desire to love Krwa in his particular relationship be­
comes intensified, this is known as pure love of Godhead. In the be­
ginning a devotee is engaged in the regulative principles of devotional
service by the order of his spiritual master. When one thereby be­
comes completely purified of all material contamination, there de­
velops an attachment and taste for devotional service. This taste and
attachment, when gradually intensified in the course of time, be­
comes love. The word "love" can only be actually applied in relation­
ship with the Personality of Godhead. In the material world, love is
not applicable at all. What goes on under the name of love in the
material world is nothing but lust. There is a gulf of difference be­
tween love and lust, like the difference between gold and iron. In the
Niirada-paiicariitra it is clearly stated that when lust is completely

transferred to the Supreme Godhead and the concept of kinship is
completely reposed in Him, such is accepted as pure love of God by
great authorities like Bhi�ma, PrahHida, Uddhava and Narada.
A great authority like Blu�ma has explained that love of Godhead
means completely giving up all so-called love for any other person.
According to Bhi�ma, love means to repose one's affection complete­
ly upon one person, withdrawing all affinities for any other person.
This pure love can be transferred to the Supreme Personality of God­
head under two conditions-out of ecstasy and out of the causeless
mercy of the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself.
Ecstatic love of Godhead can be potently invoked simply by fol­
lowing the rules and regulations of devotional service as they are pre­
scribed in scriptures, under the direction of a bona fide spiritual mas147

148

The Nectar of Devotion

ter. In the Eleventh Canto, 2nd Chapter, 38th verse, of the Srimad­

Bhiigavatam this ecstatic love, born of the execution of regulative de­
votional service, is explained: "A devotee, in the course of executing
the regulative principles of devotional service, develops his natural
Kr�!la consciousness, and being thus softened at heart he chants and
dances like a madman. While performing chanting of the holy name
of the Lord, he sometimes cries, sometimes talks wildly, sometimes
sings, and sometimes-without caring for any outsider-dances like a
madman."

In the Padma Puriir-a there is a statement about ecstatic love born

of spontaneous affection. Candrakanti, a celebrated fair-faced girl,
rigidly observed celibacy in order to obtain Kr�!J.a as her husband.
She always engaged herself in meditating on the transcendental form
of the Lord and always chanted the glories of the Lord. She did not
desire to accept anyone else as her husband. She had firmly decided
that only Lord Kr�!la would be her husband.

The Lord's Extraordinary Mercy
When a devotee is found to be always associated with the Lord in
ecstatic love, it is to be understood that such a position is awarded by
the Lord Himself out of His causeless extraordinary mercy. An exam­
ple of such extraordinary mercy is given in the Eleventh Canto, 12th
Chapter, 6th verse, of the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, wherein Lord Kr�!la

tells Uddhava: "The gopis in Vrndavana did not study-the Vedas to

achieve Me. Nor had they ever been in holy places of pilgrimage. Nor
did they devoutly execute any regulative principle. Nor did they un­
dergo any kind of austerity. It is simply by My association that they
have attained the highest perfection of devotional service."

From the example of Candrakanti as found in the Padma Puriir-a

and from the

example

of

the gopis

as found in the Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, it appears that a devotee who always thinks of Kr�!la
and who always chants His glories in ecstatic love, regardless of his
condition, will attain the highest perfection of unalloyed devotional
love due to Lord Kr�!J.a's extraordinary mercy. This is confirmed in

Devotional Service in Love of God

149

the Srimad-Bhiigavatam: "If Hari, the Supreme Lord, is worshiped,
adored and loved by a person, it should be understood that the per­
son has finished all kinds of austerities, penances and similar pro­
cesses for self realization. On the other hand, if after undergoing all
types of austerities, penances and mystic yoga practices, one does not
develop such love for Hari, then all his performances are to be con­
sidered a useless waste of time. If someone always sees Kr�rta inside
and out, then it is to be understood that he has surpassed all austeri­
ties and penances for self realization. And if, after executing all kinds
of penances and austerities, one cannot always see Kr�rta inside and
out, then he has executed his performances uselessly."
Spontaneous attraction to Kr�fla, which is said to be due to the
extraordinary mercy of the Lord, can be placed under two headings:
one is profound veneration for the greatness of the Lord, and the
other may be one's automatically being attracted to Kr�rta without
any extraneous consideration. In the Niirada-paficariitra it is said that
if on account of profound veneration for the greatness of the Su­
preme Lord, one attains a great affection and steady love for Him,
one is certainly assured of attaining the four kinds of Va�r-ava libera­
tion-namely, achieving the same bodily features as tpe Lord, achiev­
ing the same opulence as the Lord, dwelling on the planet where the
Lord is residing, and attaining eternal association with the Lord. The
Vai�r-ava liberation is completely different from the miiyiiviida libera­
tion, which is simply a matter of being merged into the effulgence of
the Lord.
In the Niirada-paficariitra pure unalloyed devotional service is ex­
plained as being without any motive for personal benefit. If a devotee
is continuously in love with Lord Kr�rta and his mind is always fixed
upon Him, that devotional attitude will prove to be the only means
of attracting the attention of the Lm:d. In other words, a Vai�r-ava
who is incessantly thinking of the form of Lord Krwa is to be known
as a pure

Va�r-ava.

Generally, a devotee who has achieved the causeless mercy of the
Lord on account of following the strict rules and regulations of devo­
tional service becomes attracted by the supreme greatness of the
Lord, by the transcendental beauty of the Lord and by the spon-

150

The Nectar of Devotion

taneous execution of devotional service. To be more clear, by exe­

cuting the regulative principles of devotional service, one can fully

appreciate the transcendental beauty of the Lord. In any case, such
exalted positions are only possible by the extraordinary mercy of the
Lord upon the devotee.

Association with Pure Devotees

Although many different processes for developing love of Godhead

have been explained so far, Srila Riipa Gosvami now gives us a general
description of how one can best achieve such a high position. The

beginning of ecstatic love of Godhead is basically faith. There are
many societies and associations of pure devotees, and if someone
with just a little faith begins to associate with such societies, his ad­
vancement to pure devotional service is rapid.

The influence of a pure devotee is such that if someone comes to

associate with him with a little faith, he gets the chance of hearing

about the Lord from authoritative scriptures like the Bhagavad-gitii

and Srimad-Bhiigavatam. Thus, by the mercy of the Lord, who is

situated in everyone's heart, one gradually develops his faith in the
descriptions of such authoritative scriptures. This is the first stage of
association with pure devotees. In the second stage, after one be­

comes a little advanced and mature, he automatically offers to follow

the principles of devotional service under the guidance of the pure

devotee and accepts him as the spiritual master. In the next stage,
under the guidance of the spiritual master, the devotee executes regu­

lative devotional service, and, as a result of such activities, he becomes
freed from all unwanted occupations. When he is freed from unwant­

ed occupations, his faith becomes steadily fixed, and he develops a
transcendental taste for devotional service, then attachment, then ec­

stasies, and in the last stage there is pure love of Godhead. These are
the different stages of the development of pure love.

Only the most fortunate persons can achieve such success in life.
Those who are simply academic students of the Vedic scriptures can­

not appreciate how such a development takes place. In the Niiriiya[ta

Devotional Service in Love of God

151

Paficariitra Lord Siva therefore tells Parvati: "My dear supreme god­

dess, you can know from me that any person who has developed the
ecstasy of love for the Supreme Personality of Godhead, and who is

always merged in transcendental bliss on account of this love, cannot

even perceive the material distress or happiness coming from the body

or mind."

Affection and the dealings of love are different branches of the

original tree of love preceding the many varieties of affectionate

manifestations, which will no t be discussed here. These different
manifestations have been described by Sanatana Gosvami in his

Bhiigavatiimrta. Although the subject of such affections and dealings

of love are very confidential, Sanatana Gosvami has described them

•

very explicitly.

Sri Riipa Gosvami thus concludes the first division of the Bh a kti­

rasamrta-sindhu, offering up his treatise for the transcendental plea­

sure of Sanatana Gosvami, who has established the transcendental

beauty, and of Gopala Bhatta Gosvami, Sri Raghuniitha Bhatta Go­

svam'i and Raghuniithadas Gosvami It appears from this statement
that the great Srila .J'iva Gosviimi was not yet active when Bhakti­

rasamrta-sindhu was written.

Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta summary study of the first division
of Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, up to the descriptions of ecstatic love of
Godhead, which are to follow next.

PART TWO

20 I Transcendental Mellow

In this second division of Bhakti-rasiimrta-sindhu the author offers
his respectful obeisances unto "Saniitana." This Saniitana can be in­

terpreted as either Sri Kr�!la Himself or as Sanatana Gosvami, the
elder brother and spiritual master of Riipa Gosvami. In the case where

Saniitana is accepted to mean Sri Kr�!la, the obeisances are offered to

Kr�!la because He is naturally so beautiful and because He is the killer
of the demon Agha. If it is interpreted to mean Sanatana Gosvami,
then it is because he is so greatly favored by Riipa Gosvami, being
always served by him, and because he is the annihilator of all kinds
of sinful activities. In this division of Bhakti-rasiimrta-sindhu the au­
thor wants to describe the general symptoms of the transcendental
mellow (loving mood) of discharging devotional service.
In this division of Bhakti-rasiimrta-sindhu there are five general

topics: 1) vibhiiva-special symptoms of ecstasy, 2) anubhiiva-sub­

sequent ecstasy, 3) siittvika-bhiiva-constitutional ecstasy, 4) vyabhi­

aggressive ecstasy and 5) sthiiyi bhiiva fervent ecstasy.
The word rasa, used in the Bhakti-rasiimrta-sindhu, is understood

cii ri bhiiva
-

-

-

-

by different persons differently because the exact English equivalent
is very difficult to find. But as we have seen our spiritual master
translate this word rasa into "mellow," we shall follow in his foot­
steps and also translate the word in that way.
The particular loving mood or attitude relished in the exchange of
love with the Supreme Personality of Godhead is called rasa, or mel­
low. The different types of rasa, when combined together, help one
to taste the mellow of devotional service in the highest degree of
transcendental ecstasy. Such a position, although entirely transcen-

152

153

The Nectar of Devotion

dental to our experience, will be explained in this section as far as
possible, following in the footsteps of Srila Riipa Gosvami.

Without relishing some sort of mellow or loving mood in one's

activities, no one can continue to perform such activities. Similarly,

in the transcendental life of Kr��a consciousness and devotional ser­

vice there must be some mellow or specific taste from the service.
Generally this mellow is experienced by chanting, hearing, worship­

ing in the temple and being engaged in the service of the Lord. So

when a person feels transcendental bliss, that is called "relishing the

mellow." To be more clear, we may understand that the various feel­

ings of happiness derived from discharging devotional service may be
termed the "mellows" of devotional service.

This relishing of transcendental mellow in discharging devotional

service cannot be experienced by all classes of men because this

sweet loving mood is developed only from one's previous life's activi­

ties, or by the association of unalloyed devotees. As explained above,

association with pure devotees is the beginning of faith in devotional

service. Only by developing such faith in the association of a pure
devotee, or by having in one's previous life executed devotional activi­
ties, can one actually relish the mellow of devotional service. In other

words, this transcendental bliss is not to be enj oyed by any common
man unless he is so extraordinarily fortunate as to be in association

with devotees or to be continuing his previous birth's devotional ac­
tivities.
The gradual process of development to the stage of devotional

service is explained in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, First Canto: "The be­
ginning is to hear about Lord Kr��a in the association of devotees

who have themselves cleansed their hearts by association. Hearing

about the transcendental activities of the Lord will result in one's

feeling transcendental bliss always." It is also explained in the

Bhagavad-gitii that for one who has actually come to the spiritual
platform, the first symptom visible will be that he is always j oyful.
This joyous life is attained by one's reaction to reading the Bhagavad­
gitii or Srimad-Bhiigavatam, or else from associating with persons
who are very interested in the spiritual life of Kr��a consciousness­

specifically those who have made the determination to achieve the

Transcendental Mellow

154

favor of Govinda by being engaged in transcendental loving service at
His lotus feet. Being encouraged by such a feeling, one who is con­

stantly engaged in dischargi ng the regulative principles of devotional
service in such a way as to please the Supreme Personality of God­
head develops two principles of compelling force, which come under
the heading of vibhiiva. Thus one enj oys transcendental bliss.

There are several origins or causes for this compulsive love of

Kr��a, such as Kr��a Himself, the devotees of Krwa, Kr��a's playing

on the flute, etc. The effect is sometimes loving and sometimes

stunted.

There are eight transcendental symptoms found in the body during
ecstasy, and all of them are possible only by a mixture of the above­
mentioned five ecstatic divisions. Without some mixture of these five

ecstatic principles, one cannot relish transcendental bliss. The cause

or basis for relishing transcendental mellow is exactly what we mean

by vibhiiva. This vibhiiva is divided into two-namely, basic and im­

petuous. In the Agni Puriirw the description of vibhiiva is given as fol­

lows: "The basis from which ecstatic love is born is called vibhiiva,

which is divided into two-basic and impetuous." In other words,

there are two kinds of ecstatic love. The object of basic ecstatic love
is Kr��a and His devotee. Lord Kr��a is the object of basic ecstatic

love, and His pure devotee, a reservoir of such love, is the object of

impetuous ecstatic love. Impetuous ecstatic love, then, is that love

which develops when one sees an object which reminds him of Kr�pa.

Lord Kr�pa, who is the possessor of inconceivable potencies and

qualities of transcendental knowledge and bliss, is the basic cause of

ecstatic love. Lord Kr��a also becomes the reservoir (impetus) of

ecstatic love by His different incarnations and expansions. In the

Srimad-Bhiigavatam there is a statement in connection with the
brahma-vimohana-lilii, which demonstrates something of this impetu­

ous feature of ecstatic love. When Brahma was deluded by Kr�pa, who
expanded Himself into so many cowherd boys, calves and cows,

Kr��a's elder brother, Sri Baladeva (a direct expansion of Kr��a Him­

self), felt astonishment and said, "How wonderful it is that my ec­

static love for Kr��a is again being attracted to so many cowherd
boys, calves and cows!" He was struck with wonder by thinking in

155

The Nectar of Devotion

this way. This is one of the examples in which Kr��a Himself becomes
the object and:reservoir of ecstatic love in the impetuous aspect.

21 I Qualities of Sri Kr��a

Personal features can be divided into two: one feature is covered,

and the other feature is manifested. When Krwa is covered by dif­

ferent kinds of dress, His personal feature is covered. There is an

example of His covered personal feature in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam in
connection with His Dvaraka filii (His residence in Dvaraka as its

king). Sometimes Lord Kr��a began to play by dressing Himself like

a woman. Seeing this form, Uddhava said, "How wonderful it is that

this woman is attracting my ecstatic love exactly as Lord Kr��a does.
I think she must be Kr��a covered by the dress of a woman!"

One devotee praised the bodily features of Kr��a when he saw

the Lord in His manifested personal feature. He exclaimed, "How

wonderful is the personal feature of Lord Kr��a! How His neck is just

like a conchshell! His eyes are so beautiful, as though they themselves

are encountering the beauty of a lotus flower. His body is j ust like

the tiimala tree, very blat:kish. His head is protected with a canopy of

hair. There are the marks of srivatsa on His chest, and He is holding

His conchshell. By such beautiful bodily features, the enemy of the
demon Madhu has appeared so pleasing that He can bestow upon me
transcendental bliss simply by my seeing His transcendental qualities."

Srila Rupa Gosvami, after consulting various scriptures, has enu­

merated the transcendental qualities of the Lord as follows:

1)

beautiful features of the entire body; 2) marked with all auspicious
characteristics; 3) extremely pleasing; 4) effulgent; 5) strong; 6) ever­

youthful; 7) a wonderful linguist; 8) truthful; 9) talks pleasingly; 10)

can speak fluently in all languages; ll) highly learned; 12) highly in­

telligent; 13) a genius; 14) artistic; 15) extremely clever; 16) expert;
156

157

The Nectar of Devotion

17) grateful; 18) firmly determined; 19) an expert judge of time and
ci rcumstances ; 20) sees and speaks on the authority of Vedas, or
scriptures; 21) pure; 22) self-controlled; 23) steadfast; 24) forebear­
ing; 25) forgiving; 26) grave; 27) self-satisfied; 28) possesses equilib­
rium; 29) magnanimous; 30) religious; 31) heroic; 32) compassionate;
33) respectful; 34) gentle; 35) liberal; 36) shy; 37) the protector of
surrendered souls; 38) happy; 39) the well-wisher of devotees; 40)
controlled by love; 41) all-auspicious; 42) most powerful; 4 3) all­
famous; 44) popular; 45) partial to devotees; 46) very attractive to
all women; 47) all-worshipable; 48) all-opulent; 49) all-honorable;
50) the supreme controller. The Supreme Personality of Godhead has
all these fifty transcendental qualities in fullness as deep as the ocean.

In other words, the extent of His qualities is inconceivable.
As parts and parcels of the Supreme Lord, the individual living en­

tit i es can also possess all of these qua liti es in minute q uan t i t ies, pro­

vided they become pure devotees of the Lord. In other words, all of

the above transcendental qualities can be present in the devotees in

minute quantity, whereas the qualities in fullness are always present
in the Supreme Personality of Godhead.

Besides these, there are other transcendental qualities which are

described by Lord Siva to Parvati in the Padma Puriirw and in the

First Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, in connection with a conversation

between the demigod of the earth and the King of religion, Yamaraj.
It is said therein: "Persons who are desirous of becoming great per­

sonalities must be decorated with the following qualities: truthful­

ness, cleanliness, mercy, perseverence, renunciation, peacefulness,

simplicity, control of the senses, equilibrium of the mind, austerity,
equality, forbearance, placidity, learning, knowledge, opulence, chiv­

alry, influence, strength, memory, independence, tactfulness, luster,
patience, ability to talk, gravity, steadiness, faithfulness, fame, re­

spectfulness and lack of false egotism." Persons who are desiring to

become great souls cannot be without any of the above qualities, so
we can know for certain that these qualities are found in Lord Kr�!la,

the supreme soul.

Besides all of the above-mentioned fifty qualities, Lord Kr�!la pos­

sesses five more, which are sometimes partially manifested in the per-

Qualities of Sri K[§[W

158

sons of Lord Brahma or Lord Siva. These transcendental qualities are
as follows: 51) changeless; 52) all-cognizant; 53) ever-fresh; 54) sac­

cid-iinanda (possessing an eternal blissful body); 55) possessing all
mystic perfection.

Kr�.pa also possesses five other qualities, which are manifest in the

body of Naraya.pa, and they are listed as follows: 56) He has incon­
ceivable potency. 57) Uncountable universes generate from His body.

58) He is the original source of all incarnations. 59) He is the giver of

salvation to the enemies whom He kills. 60) He is the attractor of lib­

erated souls. All these transcendental qualities are manifest wonder­
fully in the personal feature of Lord Kr�.pa.

Besides these sixty transcendental qualities, Kr�.pa has four more,

which are not manifest even in the Naraya.pa form of Godhead, not
to speak of the demigods or living entities. They are as follows: 61)

He is the performer of wonderful varieties of pastimes (especially His

childhood pastimes). 62) He can attract all living entities all over the

universes by playing on His flute. 63) He is surrounded by devotees

endowed with wonderful love of Godhead. 64) He has a wonderful
excellence of beauty which cannot be rivalled anywhere in the
creation.

Adding to the list these four exceptional qualities of Kr�.pa, it is to

be understood that the aggregate number of qualities of Kr�l!a is sixty­
four. Snla Rupa Gosvami has attempted to give evidences from various
scriptures about all sixty-four qualities present in the person of the
Supreme Lord.
1. Beautiful Bodily Features

Any comparison of the different parts of the Lord's body to

different material objects cannot factually be a complete com­
parison.

Ordinary persons, who cannot understand how exalted

are the bodily features of the Lord, are simply given a chance
to understand by a material comparison. It is said that Kn�a's

face is as beautiful as the moon, His thighs are powerful, just
like the trunks of elepha n t s

,

His arms are just like two pillars,

His palms are expanded like lotus flowers, His chest is just like

159

The Nectar of Devotion

a doorway, His hips are dens, and the middle of His body

IS

a

terrace.

2. Auspicious Characteristics
There are certain characteristics of different limbs which are con­
sidered to be very auspicious and are fully present in the body of the
Lord. In this connection, one friend of Nanda Maharaj , speaking
about Lord Kr�tJ.a's auspicious bodily symptoms, said, "My dear King
of the cowherds, I can find 32 auspicious symptoms on the body of
your son! I am wondering how this boy could have taken his birth in
the family of cowherd men." Generally, when Lord Kr�tla appears
He does so in a family of k§atriyas (kings), as did Lord Ramacandra,
and sometimes in a family of briihmar;ws. But Kr9�a accepted the
role of son to Maharaj Nanda, despite the fact that Nanda belonged
to the vaisya community. The business of the vaisya community is
trade, commerce and the protection of cows. Therefore his friend,
who may have been born into a briihmar-a family, expressed his won­
der at how such an exalted child could take birth in a family of

vaisyas. Anyway, he pointed out the auspicious signs on the body of
Kr9�a to the boy's foster father.
He continued: "This boy has a reddish luster in seven places-His
eyes, the ends of His hands, the ends of His legs, His palate, His lips,
His tongue and His nails. A reddish luster in these seven places is con­
sidered to be auspicious. Three parts of His body are very broad: His
waist, forehead and chest. Three parts of His body are short: His neck,
thighs and genitals. Three parts of His body are very deep: His voice,
intelligence and navel. There is highness in five parts of His body: His
nose, arms, ears, forehead and thighs. In five parts of His body there
is fineness- His skin, the hairs on His head and on the other parts of
His body, His teeth and finger tips. The aggregate of all these bodily
features are manifest only in the bodies of great personalities."
The fate lines on the palm are also considered to be auspicious
bodily symptoms. In this connection, one old gopi informed King
Nanda:

"Your son possesses various wonderful fate lines on His

palms. There are the signs of lotus flowers and wheels on His palms,

Qualities of Sri K[§!la

160

and on His soles there are the signs of a flag, thunderbolt, fish, rod
for controlling elephants and a lotus flower. Please observe how aus­
picious these signs are!"
3. Pleasing

Beautiful bodily features which automatically attract the eyes are
called rncira (pleasing). Kr�!!a possesses this attractive feature of
rncira in His personal features. In the Third Canto, 2nd Chapter, 13th

verse, of Srimad-Bhiigavatam there is a statement about this. "The

Supreme Personality of Godhead, in His pleasing dress, appeared at
the scene of the sacrificial arena when King Yudhi�thira was perform­

ing the riija-siiya sacrifice. All important personalities from different
parts of the universe had been invited to the sacrificial arena, and all

of them, upon beholding Kr�!la there, considered that the Creator
had ended all of His craftsmanship in the creation of this particular
body of Kr�!!a."
It is said that the transcendental body of Kr�!la resembles the lotus
flower in eight parts-namely, His face, His two eyes, His two hands,

His navel, and His two feet. The gop is and inhabitants of V rndavana

used to see the luster of lotus flowers everywhere, and they could
hardly withdraw their eyes from such a vision.
4. Effulgent

The effulgence pervading the universe is considered to be the rays
of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. The supreme abode of Krwa
is always throwing off the effulgence known as

brahma-jyoti, and

that effulgence is emanating from His body.
The luster of the hosts of jewels fixed on the chest of the Lord can
defeat even the luster of the sun, and still, when compared with the
bodily luster of the Lord, that crest of jewels appears to be only as
bright as one of the stars in the sky. Therefore the transcendental
influence of Kr�!la is so great that it can defeat anyone. When Kr�!la
was present in the sacrificial arena of His enemy, King Kamsa, the
wrestlers present, although appreciating the softness of the body of

161

The Nectar of Devotion

Sri Kr�!la, were nevertheless afraid and perturbed when they thought
of engaging with Him in battle.
5. Strong
A person who has extraordinary bodily strength is called baliyiin.

When Kr�!la killed Ari�tasura, some of the gopis said, "My dear
friends, just see how Kr�!la has killed Ari�tasura! Although he was
stronger than a mountain, Kr�!!a plucked him up just like a piece of
cotton and threw him away without any difficulty!" There is another
passage wherein it is said: "0 my dear devotees of Lord Krwa, may

the left hand of Lord Kr�!!a, which has lifted Govardhana Hill like a
ball, save you from all dangers."
6. Ever-youthful

Kr��a is beautiful at His different ages-namely, His childhood, His
boyhood and His youth. Out of these three, His youth is the reservoir
of all pleasures and is the time when the highest varieties of devo­
tional service are acceptable. At that age, Kr��a is full with all tran­
scendental qualities and is engaged in His transcendental pastimes.
Therefore, devotees have accepted the beginning of His youth as the
most attractive feature in ecstatic love.
At this age Kr��a is described as follows: "The force of Kr��a's
youth was combined with His beautiful smile, which defeated even
the beauty of the full moon. He was always nicely dressed, in beauty
surpassing even Cupid, and He was always attracting the minds of the
gopis, who were thereby always feeling pleasure."
7. Wonderful Linguist

Riipa Gosvami says that a person who knows the languages of dif­
ferent countries, especially the Sanskrit language, which is spoken in
the cities of the demigods-as well as other worldly languages, in­
cluding those of the animals-is called a wonderful linguist. It appears
from this statement that Kr�!la can also speak and understand the

Qualities of Sri Kr§!W

162

languages of the animals. An old woman in Vrndavana, present at the
time of Kg;J)a's pastimes, once stated in surprise: "How wonderful it
is that Kr§if)a, who owns the hearts of all the young girls of Braja·
bhiimi, can nicely speak the language of Brajabhiimi with the gopis,
while in Sanskrit He speaks with the demigods, and in the language
of the animals He can even speak with the cows and buffalo! Similar·
ly, in the language of the Kashmere Province, and with the parrots
and other birds, as well as in most common languages, Kr�J)a is so ex·
pressive!" She inquired from the gopis as to how Kr�J)a had become
so expert in speaking so many different types of languages.
8.

Truthful
A person whose word of honor is never broken is called truthful.

K.r�J)a once promised Kunti, the mother of the PaJ)«).avas, that He
would bring her five sons back from the battlefield of Kuruk�etra.
After the battle was finished, when all the Pandavas had come home,
Kunti praised Kr�J)a because His promise was so nicely fulfilled.

She said, "Even the sunshine may one day become cool and the
moonshine may one day become hot, but still Your promise will not
fail. Similarly, when K.r�J)a, along with Bhima and Arjuna, went to
challenge Jarasandha, He plainly told Jarasandha that He was the
eternal. l<.r§if)a, present along with two of the Paf)«).avas. The story is
that both Krwa and the Paf)«).avas-in this case Bhima and Arjuna­
were k§atriyas (warrior-kings). Jarasandha was also a k§atriya and was
very charitable toward the briihmartas. Thus Kr�J)a, who had planned
to fight with J arasandha, went to him with Bhima and Arjuna in the
dress of briihmartas. J arasandha, being very charitable toward the

briihmm;ws,

asked them

what they wanted, and they expressed

their desire to fight with him. Then Kr�J)a, dressed as a briihmm;w,

declared Himself to be the same Kr§if)a who was the King's eternal
enemy.
9. Pleasing Talker

A person who can speak sweetly even with his enemy just to paci-

The Nectar of Devotion

163

fy him is called a pleasing talker. Kr��a was such a pleasing talker
that after defeating His enemy, Kaliya, in the water of Yamuna,
He said: "My dear King of the snakes, although I have given you so
much pain, please do not be dissatisfied with Me. It is My duty to
protect these cows, which are worshiped even by the demigods. Only
in order to save them from the danger of your presence have I been
obliged to banish you from this place."

Kaliya was residing within the water of the Yamuna, and as a re­
sult the back portion of that river had become poisoned. Thus so
many cows who had drunk the water had died. Therefore Kr�pa, even
though He was only four or five years old, dipped Himself into the
water, punished Kaliya very severely and then asked him to leave the
place and go elsewhere.
Krwa said at that time that the cows are worshiped even by
the demigods, and He practically demonstrated how to protect the

cows. At least people who are in Krwa consciousness should follow
in His footsteps and give all protection to the cows. Cows are wor­
shiped not only by the demigods. Kr� �a Himself worshiped the cows
on several occasions, especially on the days of Gopii§tami and Govar­

dhana FUjii.
10. Fluent in All Languages
A person who can speak meaningful words and with all politeness

and good qualities is called viivaduka, or fluent. There is a nice state­

ment in the Snmad-Bhiigavatam regarding Kr��a's speaking politely.
When Kr��a politely bade His father, N anda Maharaj, to stop the

ritualistic offering of sacrifice to the raingod, lndra, a wife of one vil­
lage cowherd man became captivated. She later thus described the
speaking of Kr��a to her friends: "Kr�pa was speaking to His father

so politely and gently that it was as if He were pouring nectar into
the ears of all present there. After hearing such sweet words from
Krsna,
who will not be attracted to Him?"
.
Kr�pa's speech, which contains all good qualities in the universe, is
.

.

described in the following statement by Uddhava: "The words of
Kr��a are so attractive that they can immediately change the heart of

Qualities of Sri K[§!W

164

even His opponent. His words can immediately solve all of the ques­
tions and problems of the world. Although He does not speak very
long, each and every word from His mouth contains volumes of
meaning. These speeches of Krwa are very pleasing to my heart."
11. Highly Learned

When a person is highly educated and acts strictly on moral prin­
ciples, he is called highly learned. A person conversant in different
departments of knowledge is called educated, and because he acts on
moral principles, he is called morally stout. Together, these two fac­
tors constitute learning.
Kr�.p.a's receiving education from Sandipani Muni is described by

Sri Narada Muni as follows: "In the beginning, Lord Brahma and
others are as clouds of evaporated water from the great ocean of
Kr�.p.a. In other words, Brahma first received the Vedic education
from Kr�.p.a, as the clouds receive water from the ocean. That Vedic
education or instruction which was spoken by Brahma to the world
was then reposed upon the mountain of Sandlpani Muni. Sandipani
Muni's instructions to Kr�.p.a are like a reservoir of water on the
mountain, which flows as a river and goes again to mix with the
source, the ocean of Kr�.p.a." To be more clear, the idea is that Kr�.p.a
actually cannot be instructed by anyone, just as the ocean does not
receive water from any source but itself. It only appears that the
rivers are pouring water into the ocean. So it is clear that Brahma
received his education from Kr�.p.a, and from Brahma, via the discip­
lic succession, this Vedic instruction was distributed. Sandlpani
Muni is likened to the river which is flowing down again to that same

original ocean of Kr�.p.a.
The Siddhas, the inhabitants of Siddha-loka (where all are born
with fully developed mystic powers), and the Ciirar-as, the inhabi­
tants of a similar planet, pray to Kr�.p.a as follows: "My Lord Govinda,
the goddess of learning, who is decorated with fourteen kinds of
educational ornaments, whose intelligence is all-pervading within the

four departments of the Vedas, whose attention is always on the
lawbooks given by great sages like Manu, and who is appareled in six

165

The Nectar of Devotion

kinds of expert knowledge-namely Vedic evidence, grammar, astrolo­

gy, rhetoric, vocabulary, and logi c, and whose constant friends are

the supplements of the

Vedas and Purii[laS, decorated with the

final conclusion of all education-has now acquired an opportunity
to sit with You as a class friend in school, and she is now engaged in
Your service."
Kr�r;ta, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, does not require any
education, but He gives a chance to the goddess of learning to serve
Him. Being self-sufficient, Kr�r;ta does not require the service of any

living entity, although He has many devotees. It is because Kr�pa

is so kind and merciful that He gives the opportunity to everyone to
serve Him, as though He requires the service of His devotees.
Regarding

His moral principles, it is stated in the Srimad­

Bhiigavatam that Kr�r;ta is ruling over V rndavana as death personified
to the thieves, as pleasing bliss to the pious, as the most beautiful
Cupid to the young girls and as the most munificent personality to

the poor men. He is as refreshing as the full moon to His friends, and

to His opponents He is the annihilating fire generated from Lord
Siva. Kr�r;ta is therefore the most perfect moralist in His reciprocal
dealings with different kinds of persons. When He is death personified

to the thieves, it is not that He is without moral principles or that He
is cruel; He is still kind, because to punish thieves with death is to
exhibit the highest quality of moral principles. In the Bhagavad-gitii,

also, Kr�r;ta says that He deals with different kinds of persons accord­

ing to their dealings with Him. Kr�r;ta's dealings with devotees and
with nondevotees, although different, are both equally good. Because
Kr�r;ta is all good, His dealings with everyone are always good.
12. Highly Intelligent

A man is called intelligent if he has a sharp memory and fine
discretion. As far as Krwa 's memory is concerned, it is said that

when He was studying in the school of S andip ani Muni in Avantipur,

He showed such a sharp memory that by once taking instructions

from the teacher He immediately became perfect in any subject. Ac­

tually, His going to the school of Sandipani Muni was to show the

Qualities of Sri K[§[W

166

people of the world that however great or ingenious one may be, he
must go to higher authorities for general education. However great
one may be, he must accept a teacher or spiritual master.

Krwa's fine discretion was exhibited when He was fighting with

the untouchable king who attacked the city of Mathura. According

to Vedic rites, those who are untouchable are not to be touched by
the k§atriya kings, not even for killing. Therefore, when the untouch­

able king seized the city of Mathura, Kr�tta did not think it wise to
kill him directly with His own hand. Still the king had to be killed,

and therefore Kr�ra decided with fine discretion that He should flee

from the battlefield so that the untouchable king would chase Him.
He could then lead the king to the mountain where Mucukunda was

lying asleep. Mucukunda had received a benediction from Lord Siva

to the effect that when he awoke from his sleep, whomever he might

see would at once be burnt to ashes. Therefore Kr�tta thought it wise

to lead the untouchable king to that cave so that the king's presence
would awaken Mucukunda, and he would at once be burnt to ashes.
13. Genius

A person is called a genius when he can refute any kind of oppos­

ing element with newer and newer arguments. In this connection

there is a statement in Padyavali which contains the following con­

versation between Kr�tta and Radha: One morning, when Kr�tta came
to Radha, Radha asked Him, "My dear Kesava, where is Your vasa at

present?" The Sanskrit word vasa has three meanings: one meaning
is residence, one meaning is fragrance, and another meaning is dress.

Actually Radharatti inquired from Kr�tJ.a, "Where is Your dress?"

But Krwa took the meaning as residence, and He replied to Radha­

ratJ.i, "My dear captivated one, at the present moment my residence
is in Your beautiful eyes."

To this Radharatti replied, "My dear cunning boy, I did not ask

You about Your residence. I inquired about Your dress."
Kr�tta then took the meaning of vasa as fragrance and said, "My

dear fortunate one, I have just assumed this fragrance in order to be

associated with Your body."

167

The Nectar of Devotion

Srimati Radhara�i again enquired from Kr��a, "Where did You

pass Your night?" The exact Sanskrit word used in this connection

was yiiminyiimu§ita"{!,. Yiiminyiim means at night, and U§ita"{!, means

pass. Kr��a, however, divided the word yiiminyiimu§ita"{!, into two

separate words, namely yiiminyii and mu§ita"{!,. By dividing this word

into two, it came out to mean that He was kidnapped by Yamini, or

night. Kr��a therefore replied to Radhara�i, "My dear Radharapi, is

it possible that night can kidnap Me?" In this way He was answering

all of the questions of Radhara�i so cunningly that He gladdened this
dearest of the gopis.
14. Artistic

One who can talk and dress himself very artistically is called

vidagdha. This exemplary characteristic was visible in the person­

ality of Sri Kr��a. It is spoken of by Radhara�i as follows: "My

dear friend, just see how Kr��a has nicely composed songs and how

He dances and speaks funny words and plays on His flute, wearing

such nice garlands. He has dressed Himself in such an enchanting way,

as though He has defeated all kinds of players at the chessboard. He

lives wonderfully at the topmost height of artistic craftsmanship."
15. Clever

A person who can perform various types of work at once is called

clever. In this connection one of the gopis said: "My dear friends,

just see the clever activities of Sri Kr��a! He has composed nice songs

about the cowherd boys and is pleasing the cows. By the movement
of His eyes He is pleasing the gopis, and at the same time, He is fight­

ing with demons like Ari�tasura and others. In this way, He is sitting
with different living entities in different ways, and He is thoroughly

enjoying the situation."
16. Expert

Any person who can quickly execute a very difficult task is called

Qualities of Sri Knrw

168

expert. About the expertise of Kr�!ia there is a statement in the Tenth
Canto, 59th Chapter, 13th verse, of the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, wherein

Sukadeva Gosvami tells Maharaj Parik�it: "0 best of the Kurus, Sri

Krwa cut into pieces all the different weapons used by different
fighters." Formerly, fighting was done by releasing different kinds of

arrows. One party would release a certain arrow, and the other party

had to defeat it by counteracting it with another arrow. For ex­

ample, one party might release an arrow which would cause water to
pour from the sky, and to counteract this, the opposing party would
have to release an arrow which could immediately turn the water into
clouds. So from this statement it appears that Kr�!la was very

expert in counteracting the enemy's arrows. Similarly, at the riisa
dance, each and every gopi requested that Kr�!la individually become
her partner, and Kr�!la immediately expanded Himself into so many

Kr�!ias in order to be coupled with each and every gopi. The result
was that each gopi found Kr�!la by her side.
1 7.

Grateful

Any person who is conscious of his friend's beneficent activities

and never forgets his service is called grateful. In the Mahiibhiirata,

Kr�!ia says, "When I was away from Draupadi, she cried with the

words, 'Hey, Govinda!' This call for Me has put Me in her debt, and

that indebtedness is gradually increasing in My heart." This statement

by Kr�!ia gives evidence of how one can please the Supreme Lord
simply by addressing Him: "Hey, Krwa! Hey, Govinda!"
The

mahii-mantra (Hare Kn!w, Hare Kr§fla, K[§[la Kr§fla, Hare
Hare/ Hare Riima, Hare Riima, Riima Riima, Hare Hare) is also simply
an address to the Lord and His energy. So to anyone who is constant­

ly engaged in addressing the Lord and His energy, we can imagine how
much the Supreme Lord is obliged. It is impossible for the Lord to

ever forget such a devotee. It is clearly stated in this verse that anyone

who addresses the Lord immediately attracts the attention of the
Lord, who always remains obliged to him.

Another instance of Kr�!la's feeling of obligation is stated in con­

nection with His dealings with Jambavan. When the Lord was present

169

The Nectar of Devotion

as Lord Ramacandra, Jambavan, the great king of the monkeys, ren­
dered very faithful service to Him. When the Lord again appeared as
Lord Kr��a, He married Jambavan 's daughter and paid him all the
respect that is usually given to superiors. Any honest person is
obliged to his friend if some service has been rendered unto Him.
Since Kr��a is the supreme honest personality, how can He forget an
obligation to His servitor?

18. Determined
Any person who observes regulative principles and fulfills his prom­
ises by practical activity is called determined. As far as the Lord's
determination is concerned, there is an example in His dealings in the

Harivamsa. This is in conue..cJion with Lord Kr��a's fighting the King
of heaven, lndra, who was forcibly bereft of the piirijiita flower.
Piirijiita is a kind of lotus flower grown on the heavenly planets. Once,
Satyabhama, one of Krwa's queens, wanted that lotus flower, and
Kr��a promised to deliver it; but Indra refused to part with his

piirijiita flower. Therefore there was a great fight, with Kr��a and the
Pa�9avas on one side and all of the demigods on the other. Ultimate­
ly, Kr��a defeated all of them and took the piirijiita flower, which He
presented to His queen. So, in regard to that occurrence, Kr��a told
Narada Muni, "My dear great sage of the demigods, now you can
declare to the devotees in general, and to the nondevotees in particu­
lar, that in this matter of taking the piirijiita flower, all the demigods
-the Gandharvas, the Nagas, the demon Rak�asas, the Yak�as, the
Pannagas-tried to defeat Me, but none could make Me break My
promise to My queen."
There is another promise by Kr��a in the Bhagavad-gitii to the ef­
fect that His devotee will never be vanquished. So a sincere devotee
who is always engaged in the transcendental loving service of the Lord
should know for certain that Kr��a will never break His promise. He
will always protect His devotees in every circumstance.
Kr��a showed how He fulfills His promise by delivering the piirijiita
flower to Satyabhama, by saving Draupadi from being insulted and
by freeing Arjuna from the attacks of all enemies.

Qualities of Sri Kmw

170

The promise of l<fwa that His devotees are never vanquished had
also previously been admitted by Indra when he was defeated in the
Govardhana-Zila. When Kr��a stopped the villagers of Braja (Vrnda­
vana) from worshiping Indra, Indra became angry and therefore inun­
dated Vrndavana with continual rain. Kr��a, however, protected all
of the citizens and animals of Vrndavana by lifting Govardhan Hill,
which served as an umbrella. After the incident was over, Indra sur­
rendered to Kr��a with many prayers, in which he admitted, "By
Your lifting Govardhan Hill and protecting the citizens of Vrndavana,
You have kept Your promise that Your devotees are never to be van­
quished."
19. Expert Judge of Time and Circumstances
Kr��a was very expert in dealing with people according to circum­
stances, country, time and paraphernalia. How He could take advan­
tage of a particular time, circumstance and person is expressed by
Him while talking to U ddhava about His riisa dance with the gopis. He

says: "The most opportune time is the full moon night in autumn,
like tonight. The best place within the universe is Vrndavana, and the
most beautiful girls are the gopis. So, My dear friend U ddhava, I
think I should now take advantage of all these circumstances and en­
gage Myself in the riisa dance."

20. Seer by the Authority of the Scriptures
A person who acts exactly according to the tenets of scripture is

called siistra-cak�us. Siistra-cak�us means one who sees through the eyes
of the authorized scriptures. Actually, any man of knowledge and ex­
perience should see everything through these books. For example,
with our naked eye we perceive the sun globe simply as some glaring
substance, but when we see through authorized books of science and
other literature, we can understand how much greater the sun globe
is than this earth and how powerful it is. So seeing things through the
naked eye is not actually seeing. Seeing things through the authorized
books or authorized teachers is the correct way to see. So, although

171

The Nectar of Devotion

Kr��a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and can see all that is

past, present and future, to teach the people in general He used to
always refer to the scriptures. For example, in the Bhagavad-gitii, al­

though Kr��a was speaking as the supreme authority, He still men­

tioned and quoted Vediinta-siitra as authority. There is a statement
in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam wherein a person j okingly says that Krwa,

the enemy of Kamsa, is known as the seer through the siistras. In

order to establish His authority, however, He is now engaged in seeing
the gopis, whereby the gopis are becoming maddened.

21. Pure

There are two kinds of supreme purity. When one type is possessed,
one is able to deliver a sinful person. When the other type is

possessed, one does not do anything which is impure. A person who

possesses either of these qualities is called supremely pure. Kr��a is

both; He can deliver all sinful conditioned souls, and at the same
time, He never does anything by which He can be contaminated.

In this connection, Vidura, while trying to detach his elder brother,

Dhrtara�tra, from his familial attachments, said, "My dear brother,

you just fix your mind on the lotus feet of Kr��a, who is worshiped

with beautiful erudite verses by great sages and saintly persons. Kr��a
is the supreme deliverer amongst all other deliverers. Undoubtedly

there are great demigods like Lord Siva and Lord Brahma, but their
positions as deliverers depend always upon the mercy of Kr��a."

Therefore Vidura advised his elder brother Dhrtara�tra to concentrate
his mind and worship only Kr��a. If one simply chants the holy name

of Kr��a, this holy name will rise within one's heart like the powerful
sun and will immediately dissipate all the darkness of ignorance.
Vidura advised Dhrtara�tra to therefore think always of Kr��a so that

the volumes of contaminations due to sinful activities would be
washed off immediately. In the Bhagavad-gitii also Kr��a is addressed
by A rj una as param brahma param dhiimapavitram-the supreme pure.
There are many other instances exhibiting Kr�!!a's supreme purity.

Qualities of Sri Knr;w

172

22. Self-controlled
A person who can control his senses fully is called vasi, or self­

controlled. In this connection it is stated in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam:

"All the 16,000 wives of Kr�tta were so exquisitely beautiful that

their smiling and shyness were able to captivate the minds of great

demigods like Lord Siva. But still they could not even agitate the

mind of Kr�tta, in spite of their attractive feminine behavior." Every

one of the thousands of wives of Kr�tta was thinking that Kr�tta was

captivated by her feminine beauty, but this was not the case. Kr�tta is
therefore the supreme controller of senses, and this is admitted in the

Bhagavad-gitii, where He is addressed as Hr§ikesa-the master of the
senses.

.

23. Steadfast
A person who continues to work until his desired goal is achieved
is 'called steadfast.
There was a fight between Kr�tta and King Syamantaka, and Krwa

was to take a valuable j ewel from the King. The King tried to hide

himself in the forest, but Kr�tta would not become discouraged.
Kr�tta finally got the j ewel b y seeking out the King with great stead­

fastness.

24. Forbearing
A person who tolerates all kinds of troubles, even though such

troubles appear to be unbearable, is called forbearing.

When Kr�tta was residing at the place of His spiritual master, He

did not mind taking all troubles in rendering service to His guru, al­

though His body was very soft and delicate. It is the duty of the
disciple to execute all services unto the spiritual master, despite all

kinds of difficulties. The disciple living at the residence of the spiri­
tual master has to go begging from door to door and bring everything
back to the spiritual master. When prasiidam is being served, the spiri­
tual master is supposed to call each and every disciple to come eat.

173

The Nectar of Devotion

If by chance the spiritual master forgets to call a disciple to partake

of the prasiidam, it is enjoined in the scriptures that the student

should fast on that day rather than accept food on his own initiative.
There are many such strictures. Sometimes, also, Kr��a went to the

forest to collect dry wood for fuel.
25. Forgiving

A person who can tolerate all kinds of offenses from the opposite

party is known to be forgiving.

Lord Kr��a's forgiving quality is described in the Mahiibhiirata in

connection with His forbidding the killing of Sisupala. King Sisupala

was the monarch of the Cedi Kingdom, and although he happened to

be a cousin of Kr��a 's, he was always envious of Him. Whenever they

would meet, Sisupala would try to insult Kr��a and call Him ill names

as much as possible. In the arena of the riija-suya sacrifice of Maharaj

Yushi�Jhira, when Sisupala began to call Lord Kr��a ill names, Kr��a

did not care and remained silent. Some of the people at the arena

were prepared to kill Sisupala, but Kr��a restricted them. He was so

forgiving. It is said that when there is a thundering sound in the
clouds, the mighty lion immediately replies with his thundering roar.

But the lion doesn't care when all the foolish jackals begin to make

their less important sounds.

Sri Yamunacarya praises Kr��a's power of forgiveness with the

following statement: "My dear Lord Ramacandra, You are so merci­
ful to have excused the crow's clawing on the nipples of Hmaki sim­

ply because of his bowing down before You." Once Indra, the King

of heaven, assumed the form of a crow and attacked Sita (Janaki),

Lord Ramacandra's wife, by striking her on the breast. This was

certainly an insult to the universal mother, Sita, and Lord Rama­

candra was immediately prepared to kill the crow. But because later
on the crow bowed down before the Lord, He excused his offense.

Sri Yamunacarya further says in his prayer that the forgiving power

of Lord Kr��a is even greater than that of Lord Ramacandra, because

Sisupala was always in the habit of insulting Kr��a-not only in one

lifetime, but continually throughout three lives. Still, Kr��a was so

Qualities of Sri Knrw

174

kind that He gave Sisupala the salvation of merging into His existence.

From this we can understand that the goal of the monist to merge

into the effulgence of the supreme is not a very difficult problem.

Persons like Sisupala who are consistently inimical to Kr��a can also

get this liberation.
26.

Grave

A person who does not express his mind to everyone, or whose

mental activity and plan of action are very difficult to understand, is
called grave. After Lord Sri Kr��a had been offended by Brahma,

Brahma prayed to Him to be excused. But in spite of his offering nice

prayers to Kr��a, Brahma could not understand whether Kr��a was
satisfied or still dissatisfied. In other words, Kr��a was so grave that
He did not take the prayers of Brahma very seriously. Another in­

stance of Kr��a 's gravjty is found in connection with His love affairs

with Radhara�i. Kr��a was always very silent about His love affairs

with Radhara�i, so much so that Baladeva, Kr��a 's elder brother and
constant companion, could not understand the transformations of
Kr��a on account of His gravity.
27. Self-satisfied
A person who is fully satisfied in himself, without any hankering,

and who is not agitated even in the presence of serious cause for

distress, is called self-satisfied.

.
An example of Kr9�a's self-satisfaction was exhibited when He,

Arjuna and Bhima went to challenge Jarasandha, the formidable king

of Magadha, and Kr��a gave all credit to Bhima for the killing of
Jarasandha. From this we can understand that Krsna
never cares at
.

all for fame, although no one can be more famous.

.

.

An example of His not being disturbed was shown when Sisupala

began to call Him ill names. All the kings and briihmar-as assembled
at the sacrificial arena of Maharaj Yudhi�thira became perturbed and
immediately wanted to satisfy Kr��a by offering nice prayers. But

all these kings and briihmm;zas could not discover any disturbance in
Kr��a 's person.

175

The Nectar of Devotion

28. Possessing Equilibrium

A person who is unaffected by attachment and envy is said to
possess equilibrium.
An example of Kr��a's equilibrium is given in the Tenth Canto,

16th Chapter, 29th verse, of Srimad-Bhiigavatam in connection with
His chastising Kaliya, the hundred-headed serpent. While Kaliya was
being severely punished, all of his wives appeared before the Lord
and prayed as follows: "My dear Lord, You have descended to punish
all kinds of demoniac living creatures. Our husband, this Kaliya, is a
greatly sinful creature, and so Your punishment for him is quite
appropriate. We know that Your punishment for Your enemies and
Your dealings with Your sons are both the same. We know that it is
in thinking of the future welfare of this condemned creature that
You have chastised him."
In another prayer it is said, "My dear Lord Kr��a, best of all the
Kuru dynasty, You are so impartial that even if Your enemy is quali­
fied, You will reward him; and if one of Your sons is a culprit, You
will chastise him. This is Your business, because You are the supreme
author of universes. You have no partiality. If anyone finds any par­
tiality in Your characteristics, he is surely mistaken."
29. Magnanimous

Any person who is very charitably disposed is called magnanimous.
When Kr��a was reigning over Dvaraka, He was so magnanimous
and charitably disposed that there was no limit to His charity. In
fact, so great was His charity in Dvaraka that even the spiritual king­
dom, with all of its opulence of cintiimarti (touchstone), desire trees
and surabhi cows, was surpassed. In the spiritual kingdom of Lord
Kr��a, named Goloka Vrndavana, there are surabhi cows which give

unlimited quantities of milk. There are desire trees from which any­
one can take all kinds of fruits, as much as he may desire. The land
is made of touchstone, which when touched to iron will transform it
into gold. In other words, although in the spiritual kingdom, the
abode of Kr��a, everything is wonderfully opulent, still when Kr��a

Qualities of Sri K!§[La

176

was in Dvaraka His charity exceeded the opulence of Goloka Vrn­
davana. Wherever Kr�l).a is present, the limitless opulence of Goloka
Vrndavana is automatically present.
It is also stated that while Lord Krwa was living in Dvaraka, He
expanded Himself into 16,108 forms, and each and every expansion
resided in a palace with a queen. Not only was Krwa happily living
with His queens in those palaces, but He was giving in charity from
each palace an aggregate number of 13,054 cows completely deco­
rated with nice clothing and ornaments. From each of Kr�l).a's 16,108
palaces, these cows were given daily. This means that 13,054 multi­
plied by 16,108 cows were being given in charity by Kr�l).a every day.
No one can estimate the value of such a large number of cows given
in charity, but that was the system of Kr�l).a's daily affairs while He
was reigning inDvaraka.

30. Religious
A person who personally practices the tenets of religion as they
are enjoined in the siistras and who also teaches others the same prin­
ciples is called religious. Simply professing a kind of faith is not a sign
of religiousness. One must act according to religious principles, and
by his personal example he should teach others. Such a person is to
be understood as religious.
When Kr�l).a was present on this planet there was no irreligion. In
this connection, Narada Muni once addressed Kr�l).a jokingly: "My
dear Lord of the cowherd boys, Your bulls [bulls are the representa­
tion of religion] , while eating grass from the pasturing ground and
moving on their four legs, have certainly eaten up all the grass of ir­
religion!" In other words, by the grace of Kr�l).a, religious principles
were so well cared for that hardly any irreligious activities could be
found.
It is said that because Kr�l).a was constantly performing various
types of sacrifices and was inviting the demigods from the higher
planetary systems, the demigods were almost always absent from
their consorts. Therefore the wives of the demigods, regretting the
absence of their husbands, began to pray for the appearance of Lord

177

The Nectar of Devotion

Buddha, the ninth incarnation of Krgta in the age of Kali. In other
words, instead of being pleased that Lord Kr�':la had come, they be­
gan to pray for Lord Buddha, who is the ninth incarnation, because
Lord Buddha stopped the ritualistic ceremonies and sacrifices recom­
mended in the Vedas in order to discourage animal killing. The demi­
gods' wives thought that if Lord Buddha appeared, all kinds of sacri­
fices would be stopped, and thus their husbands would not be invited
to such ceremonies and thus would not be separated from them.
Sometimes it is enquired, "Why don't the demigods from higher
planetary systems come to this earth planet nowadays?" The plain
answer is that since Lord Buddha appeared and began to deprecate
the performance of sacrifice in order to stop animal killing on this
planet, the process of offering sacrifices has been stopped, and the
demigods do not care to come here anymore.

22 I Qualities of Kr��a
Further Explained

31. Heroic
A person who is very enthusiastic in military activities and expert
in releasing different kinds of weapons is called heroic.
Regarding Kr�!ia's heroism in fighting, there is the following state­
ment: "My dear killer of the enemy, just as the elephant while taking
bath in the lake destroys all the lotus stems within the water by
swinging its trunk, so· simply by moving Your arms, which are com­
pared to the trunks of elephants, You have killed so many lotus-like
.

enemies.

"

Regarding Kr�!ia's expertise in releasing weapons, when J arasandha,
along with thirteen divisions of soldiers, attacked Kr�!la's army, they
were unable to hurt even one soldier on the side of Kr�!la. This was
due to Kr�!la 's expert military training. This is unique in the history
of military art.

32. Compassionate
A person who is unable to bear another's distress is called com­
passionate.
Kr�!la's compassion for distressed persons was exhibited when He
released all of the kings imprisoned by Magadhendra. While dying,
Grandfather Bhi�ma prayed to Kr�!la and described Him as the sun
which eradicated darkness. The kings who were imprisoned by
Magadhendra were put into dark cells, and when Kr�!la appeared
there, the darkness immediately disappeared, just as if the sun had

178

179

The Nectar of Devotion

risen. In other words, although Magadhendra was able to imprison

so many kings, upon the appearance of Kr��a they were all released.
Kr��a did this out of His sincere compassion for the kings.

Kr��a's compassion was also exhibited when Grandfather Bhi�ma

was lying on the bed of arrows which had been shot through his body.

While lying in this position, Bhi�ma was very anxious to see Kr��a,

and thus Krwa appeared there. Upon seeing the pitiable condition of

Bhi�ma, Kr��a began speaking with tears in His eyes. Not only was
He shedding tears, but He also forgot Himself in His compassion.

Therefore, instead of offering obeisances to Krwa directly, devotees

offer obeisances to His compassionate nature. Actually, because

Kr��a is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, it is very difficult to
approach Him. But the devotees, taking advantage of His compassion­

ate nature, which is represented by Radhara�i, always pray to

Radhara�i for Kr��a's compassion.

33. Respectful
A person who shows adequate respect to a spiritual master, a
briihmar;w and an old person is to be understood as being respectful.

When superior persons assembled before Krwa, Kr��a first of all

offered respect to His spiritual master, then to His father and then to
His elder brother, Balarama. In this way Lord Kr��a, the lotus-eyed,

was completely happy and pure at heart in all of His dealings.

34. Gentle
Any person who neither becomes impudent nor exhibits a puffed­

up nature is called gentle.

The example of Kr��a's gentle behavior was manifested when He
was coming to the arena of the riija-siiya sacrifice arranged by

Maharaj Yudhi�thira, Kr��a's older cousin. Maharaj Yudhi�thira knew
that Kr��a was the. Supreme Personality of Godhead, and he was

attempting to get down from his chariot to receive Kr��a. But before
Yudhi�thira could get down, Lord Kr��a got down from His own
chariot and immediately fell at the feet of the King. Even though

Qualities of K[§!la Further Explained

180

Kr�!la is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, He never forgets to
show social etiquette in His dealings.

35. Liberal
Any person who is by his natural behavior very mild is called lib­
eral.
A statement by Uddhava after the Syamantaka jewel plundering
confirms that Kr�!la is so kind and favorable that if a servitor is ac­
cused even of great offenses, Kr�!la does not take this into considera ­
tion. He simply considers the service that is rendered by His devotee.

36.Shy
A person who sometimes exhibits humility and bashfulness is called
shy.
As described in the Lalita-miidhava, Kr�!!a's shyness was manifested
when He lifted Govardhan Hill by the little finger of His left hand.
All of the gopis were observing Kr�!!a's wonderful achievement, and
Krwa was also smiling at seeing the gopis. When Kr�!!a's glance went
over the breasts of the gopis, His hand began to shake, and upon
seeing His hand shake, all of the cowherd men underneath the hill
became a little disturbed. Then there was a tumultuous roaring sound,
and they all began to pray to Kr�!la for safety. At this time Lord
Balarama was smiling, thinking that these cowherd men had been
frightened by the shaking of Govardhan Hill. But, seeing Balarama
smile, Krwa thought that Balarama had understood His mind in ob­
serving the breasts of the gopis, and He immediately became bashful.

37. Protector ofSurrendered Souls
Kr�!la is the protector of all surrendered souls.
Some enemy of Kr�!la's was enlivened with the thought that he
needn't fear Kr�!ia because if he simply surrendered unto Him, Kr�!la
would give him all protection. Kr�!la is sometimes compared with the
moon, which does not hesitate to distribute its soothing rays, even on
the houses of the caflt)iilas and untouchables.

38. Happy

Any person who is always joyful and untouched by any distress is

called happy.

As far as Kr�rta's enjoyment is concerned, it is stated that the orna­

ments which decorated the bodies of Kr�rta and His queens were be­

yond the dreams of Kubera, the treasurer of the heavenly kingdom.
The constant dancing before the doors of Kr�rta's palaces was not to

be imagined even by the demigods in the heavenly kingdom. In the
heavenly kingdom, lndra always sees the dancing of the society girls.

But even Indra could not imagine how beautiful were the dances

being performed at the gates of Kr�rta's palaces. Gauri means white

woman, and Lord Siva's wife is called Gauri. The beautiful women
residing within the palaces of Kr�rta were so much whiter than Gauri
that they were compared to the moonshine, and they were constantly

visible to Krwa. Therefore, no one can be enjoying more than Kr�rta.

The conception of enjoyment is beautiful women, ornaments and

riches. And all of these things were fabulously present in the palaces
of Kr�!J.a, defeating even the imagination of Kubera, Lord Indra or
Lord Siva.

Not even a slight distress can touch Kr�rta. Once some of the gopis

went to the place where the briihmarws were performing sacrifices and

said, "My dear wives of the briihmar-as, you must know that not even

a slight smell of distress can touch Kr�!J.a. He knows no loss, He knows

no defamation, He has no fear, He has no anxiety, and He does not

know calamity. He is simply encircled by the dancers of Braja and is

enjoying their company in the rasa dance."
39. Well-wisher of His Devotees

It is said of Kr�rta's devotees that if they offer even a little water or

a tulasi leaf in devotion to Lord Vi�!J.U, Lord Vi�rtu is so kind that He

will sell Himself to them.

Kr�rta's favoritism towards His devotees was exhibited in His fight

with Bhi�ma. When Grandfather Bhi�ma was lying at the point of

death on the bed of arrows, Kr�rta was present before him, and

Qualities of K[§[ta Further Explained

182

Bhi�ma was remembering how Kr�pa had been kind to him on the

battlefield. Kr?pa had promised that in the Battle of Kuruk?etra He

would not even touch a weapon to help either side; He would remain

neutral. Although Kr�pa was Arjuna's charioteer, He had promised

that He would not help Arjuna by using any weapons. But one day
Bhi?ma, in order to nullify Kr?pa's promise, exhibited his fighting

spirit so magnificently against Arjuna that Kr?pa was obliged to get

down from His chariot. Taking up a broken chariot wheel, He ran

toward Grandfather Bhi?ma as a lion runs toward an elephant to kill
it. Grandfather Bhi�ma remembered this scene, and He later praised
Krwa for His glorious favoritism towards His devotee, Arjtma, even at

the risk of breaking His own promise.
40. Controlled by Love

Kr�pa becomes obliged to the loving spirit of the devotee and not

exactly to the service rendered. No one can serve Kr�pa completely.

He is so complete and self-sufficient that He has no need of any ser­

vice from the devotee. It is the devotee's attitude of love and affection

for Krwa that makes Him obliged. A very nice example of this obliga­

tory behavior was manifested when Sudama Vipra went to Kr?pa's

palace. Sudama Vipra had been a class friend of Kr�pa's, and due to

his poverty he was induced by his wife to see Kr�pa to request some

aid. When Sudama Vipra reached Kr�pa's palace, Krwa received him

very well, and both He and His wife washed the feet of Sudama
Vipra, showing respect to the briihmar-a. Remembering His loving

affairs with Sudama in their childhood, Kr�pa began to shed tears
while receiving him.
Another instance of Kr�pa's obligation to His devotee is described

in the Tenth Canto, 9th Chapter, 14th verse, of Srimad-Bhiigavatam

where Sukadeva Gosvami tells King Parik�it: "My dear King, when
Mother Y asoda was perspiring, tired of trying to bind Kr?pa up with

rope, Kr�pa agreed to allow her to bind Him." Kr�pa, as a child, was
disturbing His mother by His naughty activities, and she wanted to

bind Him up. Mother Y asoda brought some rope from the house and
tried to tie up the child, but she could not tie a knot due to the short-

183

The Nectar of Devotion

ness of the rope. She tied together many ropes, but when she finished
still the rope was too short. After a while she felt very tired and be­
gan to perspire. At that time Kr�!la agreed to be bound up by His
mother. In other words, no one can bind Kr�!la by any means other
than love. He is bound only by obligation to His devotees, because of
their ecstatic love for Him.
41. All-auspicious

A person who is always engaged in auspicious welfare activities for
everyone is known as all-auspicious.
After the disappearance of Lord Krwa from this planet, Uddhava
began to remember the activities of the Lord and said, "Kr�!la satis­
fied all great sages by His wonderful pastimes. He demolished all of
the demoniac activities of the cruel royal order, protected all pious
men, and killed all cruel fighters on the battlefield. Therefore He is
all-auspicious for all men."
42. Most Powerful

A person who can always put his enemy into calamities is called
powerful.
When Kr�!la was present on this planet, just as the powerful sun
drives all darkness to take shelter in caves, He drove away all of His
enemies, who fled like owls to take shelter beyond His sight.
43. All-famous

A person who becomes well-known due to his spotless character is
called famous.
It is stated that the diffusion of Kr�!!a's fame is like the moonshine
which turns darkness into light. In other words, if Kr�!la conscious�
ness is preached all QVer the world, the darkness of ignorance and the
anxiety of material existence will turn into the whiteness of purity,
peacefulness and prosperity.
When the great sage Narada was chanting the glories of the Lord,

Qualities of K[§fW Further Explained

184

the bluish line on the neck of Lord Siva disappeared. Upon seeing
this, Gaur!, the wife of Lord Siva, suspected Lord Siva of being some­

one else disguised as her husband, and out of fear she immediately
left his company. Upon hearing the chanting of Krwa's name, Lord

Balarama saw that his dress had become white, although He was gen­

erally accustomed to a bluish dress. And the cowherd girls saw all of

the water of the Yamuna River turn into milk, so they began to
churn it into butter. In other words, by the spreading of Kr�tta

consciousness, or the glories of Kr�tta, everything became white and

pure.

44. Popular

Any person who is very dear to people in general is called a popular

man.

As for Kr�tta's popularity, there is a statement in the First Canto,

11th Chapter, 8th verse, of Srimad-Bhiigavatam that deals with His

returning home from the capital of Hastinapur. While He had been

absent from Dvarakli at the Battle of Kuruk�etra, all the citizens of
Dvaraka had become morose. Then, when He returned, the citizens

joyfully received Him and said, "My dear Lord, while You were ab­

sent from the city, we passed our days in the darkness of night. As in

the darkness of night every moment appears to be a long duration of
time, so while You were gone every moment appeared to us like

millions of years. Your separation is completely unbearable to us."

This statement shows how popular Kr�tta was all over the country.

A similar incident occurred when Krsna entered the arena of sacri-

.

.

.

.

fice, arranged by King Kamsa for His death. As soon as He entered ..
the place, all the sages began to cry, "Jai! Jai! Jai!" (which means
"Victory!") Kr�tta was a boy at that time, and all the sages offered

. their respectful blessings to Him. The demigods who were present al-

so began to offer beautiful prayers to Kr�tta. And the ladies and girls
present expressed their joy from all corners of the arena. In other

words, there was no one in that particular place with whom Kr�tta

was not very popular.

185

The Nectar of Devotion

45. Partiality to Devotees
Although Kr�!la is the Supreme Personality of Godhead and is
therefore not partial to anyone, it is stated in the Bhagavad-gitii that
He has special attraction for a devotee who worships His name in love
and affection. When Kr�!la was on this planet, one devotee expressed
his feeling in this way: "My dear Lord, if You had not appeared on
this planet, then the asuras [demons] and atheists would have surely
created havoc against the activities of the devotees. I cannot imagine
the magnitude of such devastation prevented by Your presence."
From the very beginning of His appearance, Krwa was the greatest
enemy of all demoniac persons, although Kr�!!a's enmity toward the
demons is actually comparable to His friendship with the devotees.
This is because any demon who is killed by Kr�!la receives immediate
salvation.
46. Very Attractive to All Women
Any person who has special qualifications becomes immediately
very attractive to women.
A devotee made the following statement about the queens of
Dvaraka: "How shall I describe the glories of the queens at Dvaraka
who were personally engaged in the sen1.ce of the Lord? The Lord is
so great that simply by chanting His name all the great sages like
Narada can enjoy transcendental bliss. So what can be said about
those queens who were at every moment seeing the Lord and serving

Him personally?" Kr�!la had 16,108 wives in Dvaraka, and each and

every one of them was attracted to Kr�!J.a just as iron is attracted by
a magnet. There is a statement by a devotee: "My dear Lord, You are
just like a magnet, and all the damsels of Braja are just like iron: in
whichever direction You are moving they are following You as iron is
attracted by magnetic force."
47. All-worshipable
A person who is respected and worshiped by all kinds of human

Qualities of Kr§!W further Explained

186

beings and demigods is called sarviiriidhya or all-worshipable.
Krwa is worshiped not only by all living entities, including the

great demigods like Lord Siva and Lord Brahma, but also by Vi$tJ.U
expansions (forms of Godhead) such as Baladeva and S e9a. Bala­
deva is a direct expansion of Kr$tJ.a, but He still accepts Kr9rta as
worshipable. When Krwa appeared in the arena of the riija-siiya sacri­
fice organized by Maharaj Yudhi$thira, to all present, including great
sages and demigods, Kr$rta became the cynosure, the center of attrac­
tion, and everyone offered Him their respects.
48. All-opulent
Kr9rta is full in all opulences-namely, strength, wealth, fame,
beauty, knowledge, and renunciation. When Kr9rta was present in
Dvaraka, His family, which is known as the Y adu dynasty, consisted
of 560 million members. And all of these family members were very
obedient and faithful to Krsna. There were more than 900,000
big palatial buildings there to house all the people, and everyone in
them respected Kr9tta as the most worshipable. Devotees were as­
tonished to see the opulence of Krwa.
This was verified by Bilvamangala Thakur when in Kr§ra-harr-iimrta
he addressed Kr9rta thus: "My dear Lord, what can I say about the
opulence of Your Vrndavana? Simply the ornaments on the legs of
the damsels of Vrndavana are more than cintiimar-i, and their dresses
are as good as the heavenly piirijiita flowers. And the cows exactly re­
semble the surabhi cows in the transcendental abode. Therefore Your
opulence is just like an ocean that no one can measure."
49. All-honorable
A person who is chief among all important persons is called all­
honorable.

When Kr9rta was living at Dvaraka, demigods like Lord Siva, Lord

Brahma, Indra the King of heaven and many others used to come to
visit Him. The doorkeeper, who had to manage the entrance of all
these demigods, one very busy day said, "My dear Lord Brahma and

187

The Nectar of Devotion

Lord Siva, please sit down on this bench and wait. My dear lndra,

please desist from reading your prayers. This is creating a disturbance.

Please wait silently. My dear Varu�a, please go away. And my dear

demigods, do not waste your time uselessly. Kr��a is very busy; He
cannot see You!"

50. Supreme Controller

There arc two kinds of controllers, or lords: one who is indepen­

dent is called controller, and one whose orders cannot be neglected
by anyone is called controller.

Regarding Kr��a's complete independence and lordship, Srimad­

Bhiigavatam says that although Kaliya was a great offender, Kr��a

still favored him by marking his head with His lotus feet, whereas
Lord Brahma, although having prayed to Krwa with so many won­

derful verses, still could not attract Him.

This contradictory treatment by Krwa is just befitting His posi­

tion, because in all the Vedic literature He is described as the com­

plete independent. In the beginning of the Srimad-Bhiigavatam the

Lord is described as svariit, which means completely independent.

That is the position of the supreme absolute truth. The absolute

truth is not only sentient, but He is also completely independent.

As for Krwa's orders not being neglected by anyone, in Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, Third Canto, 2nd Chapter, 21st verse, Uddhava tells
Vidura: "Lord Kr��a is the master of the three modes of material

nature. He is the enjoyer of all opulences, and therefore there is no

one equal to or greater than Him." All the great kings and emperors
used to come before Him, offer their gifts and pay obeisances with

their helmets at the feet of the Lord. One devotee said, "My dear
Kr��a, when You order Brahma-'Now you may create the universe,'

-and when You order Lord Siva-'Now you dissolve this material

manifestation,'-You are in this way creating and dissolving the ma­

terial creation Yourself. Simply by Your orders and by Your partial

representation as Vi��u, You are maintaining the universes. In this

way, 0 Kr��a, 0 enemy of Kamsa, there are so many Brahmas and
Sivas who are simply carrying out Your orders."

Qualities of K[§!W Further Explained

188

51. Changeless

Krwa does not change His constitutional position, not even when
He appears in this material world. Ordinary living entities have their
constitutional spiritual positions covered. They appear in different
bodies, and under the different bodily concepts of life they act. But
Kr��a does not change His body. He appears in His own body and is
therefore not affected by the modes of material nature. In the First

Canto, llth Chapter, 24th verse, of Srimad-Bhiigavatam it is stated

that the special prerogative of the supreme controller is that He is
not at all affected by the modes of nature. The practical example of
this is that devotees who are under the protection of the Lord are
also not affected by material nature. To overcome the influence of
material nature is very difficult, but the devotees or the saintly per­
sons who are under the protection of the Lord are not affected. So
what need is there to speak of the Lord Himself? To be more clear,
although the Lord sometimes appears in this material world, He has
nothing to do with the modes of material nature, and He acts with
full independence in His transcendental position. This is the special
quality of the Lord.
52. All-cognizant

Any person who can understand the feelings of all persons and in­
cidents in all places at all times is called all-cognizant.
A nice example of the all-cognizant quality of the_ Lord is de­

scribed in Sninad-Bhiigavatam, First Canto, 15th Chapter, llth verse,

in connection with Durvasa Muni's visit to the house of the Pa��avas
in the forest. Following a calculated plan, Duryodhana sent Durvasa
Muni and his ten thousand disciples to be guests of the Pa��avas in
the forest. Duryodhana arranged for Durvasa and his men to reach
the place of the Pa��avas just when the Pa��avas' lunchtime was
�nded, so that the Pa��avas would be caught without sufficient
means to feed such a large number of guests. Knowing Duryodhana's
plan, Kr��a came to the Pa��avas and asked their wife Draupadi if
there were any remnants of food which she could offer to Him.

189

The Nectar of Devotion

Draupadi offered Him a container in which there was only a little
fragment of some vegetable preparation, and Kr��a at once ate it. At
that moment all of the sages accompanying Durvasa were taking bath
in the river, and when Kr��a felt satisfaction from eating Draupadi's
offering, they also felt satisfaction, and their hunger was gone. Be­
cause Durvasa and his men were unable to eat anything more, they
went away without coming into the house of the Pa��avas. In this
way the Pa��avas were saved from the wrath of Durvasa. Duryodhana
had sent them because he knew that the Pa��avas would not be able
to receive such a large number, and thus Durvasa would become
angry, and the Pa��avas would be cursed. But Kr��a saved them
from this calamity by His trick and by His all-cognizant quality.
53. Ever-fr esh

Kr��a is always remembered, and His name is always chanted by
millions of devotees, but the devotees never become saturated. In­
stead of becoming disinterested in thinking of Kr��a and in chanting
His holy name, the devotees get newer and newer impetus to con­
tinue the process. Therefore Kr��a is ever-fresh. Not only Kr��a Him­
self, but also Kr��a's knowledge is ever-fresh. The Bhagavad-gitii,
which was imparted 5,000 years ago, is still being read repeatedly by
many, many men, and still new light is always being found in it.
Therefore, Kr��a and His name, fame, qualities-and everything in
relationship with Him-is ever-fresh.
All the queens at Dvaraka were goddesses of fortune. It is said in
the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, First Canto, 11th Chapter, 29th verse, that
the goddesses of fortune are very fickle and restless, so no one can
consistently captivate them. Thus one's luck will always change
sometime. Yet the goddesses of fortune could not leave Kr��a for
even a moment when they were residing with Him at Dvaraka. This
means that Kr��a's attraction is ever-fresh. Even the goddesses of for­
tune cannot leave His company.
Regarding Kr��a's attractive features being ever-fresh, there is a
statement by Radhara�i in the Lalita-miidhava, in which Kr��a is
compared with the greatest sculptor because He is expert in chisling

Qualities of K[§rla Further Explained

190

at the chastity of women. In other words, although chaste women
may follow the_ rules and regulations of Vedic principles to become
ever-faithful to their husbands, Krsna is able to break their stone-like
.

.

.

chastity with the chisel of His beauty. Most of the girl friends of
Krsna were married, but because Krsna was their friend before their
.

.

.

.

.

.

marriages, they could not forget His attractive features, which were
always fascinating to them, even after their marriages.

54. Sac-cid-iinanda-vigraha
This means that Kr��a 's transcendental body is eternal, full of
knowledge and bliss. Sat means ever-existing for all time and in all
places; in other words, all-pervading in time and space. Cit means full
of knowledge. Kr��a has nothing to learn from anyone. He is inde­
pendently full of all knowledge. Ananda means the reservoir of all
pleasure. The impersonalists are seeking to merge into the Brahman
effulgence of eternity and knowledge, but the major portion of the
absolute pleasure which is in Kr��a is avoided by them. One can enjoy
the transcendental blissfulness of merging into the Brahman efful­
gence after being freed from the contamination of material illusion,
false identification, attachment, detachment and material absorption.
These are the preliminary qualifications of a person who can realize
Brahman. It is stated in the Bhagavad-gitii that one has to become
full of joyfulness; this is not exactly joyfulness, but a sense of free­
dom from all anxieties. Freedom from all anxieties may be the first
principle of joyfulness, but it is not actual joyfulness. Those who
realize the self, or become brahma-bhiita, are only preparing them­
selves for the platform of joyfulness. That joyfulness can be actually
achieved only when one comes into contact with Krwa. Kr��a con­
sciousness is so complete that it includes the transcendental pleasure
derived from impersonal or Brahman realization. Even the imper­
sonalist will become attracted to the personal form of Kr��a, known

as Syiimasundara.

It is confirmed by the statement of Brahma-samhitii that the Brah­

man effulgence is the bodily ray of Kr��a; the Brahman effulgence is
simply an exhibition of the energy of Krwa. Kr��a is the source of

191

The Nectar of Devotion

the Brahman effulgence, as He Himself confirms in the Bhagavad-gitii.

From this we can conclude that the impersonal feature of the abso­

lute truth is not the ultimate end; Kr��a is the ultimate end of the
absolute truth.

The Vai�rwva schools therefore riever try to merge into the Brah­

man effulgence in their pursuit of spiritual perfection. They accept
Kr��a as the ultimate goal of self realization. Therefore Kr��a is

called parambrahman (the supreme Brahman) or paramesvara (the su­

preme controller). Sri Yamunacarya has prayed as follows: "My dear
Lord, I know that the gigantic universe and gigantic space and time
within the universe are covered by the ten layers of the material ele­

ments, each layer ten times larger than the previous one. The three

material modes of nature, the Garbhodakasayi Vi��u, the Ksirodaka­
sayi Vi��u and the Maha-Viwu, and beyond them the spiritual sky
and its spiritual planets, known as V aiku�thas, and the Brahman ef­
fulgence in that spiritual sky -all of these taken together are nothing
but a small exhibition of Your potency."

55. Possessing All Mystic Perfections
There are many standards of perfection. The highest material per­
fections, obtained by perfect yogis, are listed as eight:· to become the
smallest of the small, to become the greatest of the great, etc. All of

these material perfections, as well as all spiritual perfections, can be
found fully in Kr��a's personality.

56. Kr§p,a's Inconceivable Potencies
Kr��a is present everywhere, not only within the universe, not
only within the heart of all living entities, but also within every atom.
In the prayers/of Queen Kunti we find mention of this inconceivable

potency of Kr��a. While Krwa was talking with Kunti, He simul­

taneously entered the womb of Uttara, who was in danger due to the

atomic weapon of Asvatthama. Kr��a can illusion even Lord Brahma
and Lord Siva, and He can protect all surrendered �evotees from the

Qualities of K[§[La Further Explained·

192

reaction of sinful activities. These are some of the examples of His
inconceivable potencies.

Srila Riipa Gosvami therefore offers his obeisances unto Kr9p.a by

saying, "Kr9p..a, who is present as a human being, has as His mere

shadow the whole material nature. He has expanded Himself into so

many cows, calves and cowherd boys, and He has again manifested
Himself in all of them as the four-handed Narayap.a. He has taught

millions of Brahmas self realization, and thus He is worshipahle not
only by the heads of all universes, but by everyone else also. There­

fore let me always accept Him as the Supreme Personality of God­
head."

When Indra was defeated by Krwa in the matter of taking the

piirijiita plant from heaven, Narada met Indra and criticized him: "0

Indra, great King of heaven, Kr9p..a has already defeated Lord Brahma

and Lord Siva. So what can be said of an insignificant demigod like

you?" Narada Muni, of course, was criticizing Indra jokingly, and
Indra enjoyed it. In Narada's statement it is confirmed that Krwa

was able to illusion even Lord Brahma and Lord Siva as well as Indra.

So there is no question of Kr9p.a 's power to do the same to lesser

living entities.

A description of Kr9p.a's power in minimizing the sufferings of sin­

ful reactions is given in Brahma-sarhhitii as follows: "Beginning from
the great King of heaven down to the ant, everyone is undergoing the

reactions of past deeds. But a devotee of Kr�p..a is relieved from such

reactions by the grace of Krwa." This was clearly proved when Krwa

went to the place of Yamaraja, the Lord of death, to reclaim the
dead sons of His teacher. Krwa's teacher had requested Him to bring

back his dead sons, and to do so Kr9p.a went to the place of Yamaraja

to claim all of those souls who had been brought there by Yamaraja

and were being kept under his control. Krwa immediately ordered

Yamaraja, "Be benefitted by My order and return those souls unto

Me!" The purport of this incident is that even a person who is under

the regulative principles of the laws of nature, and is therefore punish­

able by Y amaraja under these laws, can be granted complete im­

munity by the grace of Kr9p..a.

193

The Nectar of Devotion

Kr��a 's inconceivable potencies have been described by Sukadeva

Gosvami as follows: "Kr��a is bewildering my intelligence because,

although He is unborn, He has appeared as the son of Nanda Maharaj.

He is all-pervading, but still He is held on the lap of Y asoda. In spite

of His being all-pervasive, He has become limited by the love of
Yasoda. Although He has innumerable forms, still He is moving as

one Kr��a before His father and mother, Nanda and Yasoda. In the

Brahma-sarhhitii also it is said that although Kr��a is eternally living

in Goloka Vrndavana, His transcendental abode, He is still present
everywhere, even within the atoms.

57. Kr§!w's Body Generates Innumerable Universes

In the Tenth Canto, 14th Chapter, llth verse, of the Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, Lord Brahma says, "My dear Lord, false ego, intelli­

gence, mind, sky, air, fire, water and earth are the material in­

gredients of this universe, which can be compared to a gigantic pot. In

that gigantic pot my body is of insignificant measurement, and even

though one of the many universes is created by me, innumerable uni­

verses are coming and going from the pores of Your body, just as
atomic particles are seen flickering in the sunlight. I think I am very,

very insignificant before You, and I am therefore begging Your par-

don. Please be merciful toward me."

·

If one takes account of only one universe, he will find so many

combinations of wonderful things within, because there are innu­

merable planets, innumerable residences and places of demigods. The

length and breadth of the universe is 400 million miles by 400 million
miles, and it is infested with many unfathomable regions known as

piitiilas, or downward planetary systems. Although Kr��a is the origin
of all this, He can always be seen in Vrndavana, exhibiting His incon­
ceivable potencies. So who can adequately worship such an all­
powerful Lord, possessed of such inconceivable energy?

58. The Original Source of All Incarnations

Jayadeva Gosvami, in his Gita-govinda, has sung as follows: "The

�;;;;;;;=====-----'-�---��===���- ---

Qualities of Kr§rta Further Explained

194

Lord has saved the Vedas in His form as a fish, and He has borne the
whole universe on His back in the form of a tortoise. He has picked
up this earthly planet from the water in the form of a boar. He has
killed Hirapyakasipu in the form of Nrsimha. He has cheated Maharaj
Bali in the form of Vamana. He has annihilated all the dynasties of

the k§atriyas in the form of Parasurama. He has killed all the demons
in the form of Lord Rama. He has accepted the great plow in the
form of Balarama. He has annihilated all the atheistic persons in the
form of Kalki. And He has saved all the poor animals in the form of
Lord Buddha."* These are some of the descriptions of the incarna­

tions emanating from Kr�pa, and from the Srimad-Bhagiivatam it is
understood that innumerable incarnations are always coming out
from the body of KrJpa, just like waves in the ocean. No one can
even count how many waves there are, and similarly no one can

count how many incarnations are coming from the Lord's body.

59. Kr§rta Gives Salva.tion to the Enemies that He Kills
Another name for salvation is apavarga. Apavarga is the opposite

of pavarga, or the various miserable conditions of material existence.

Pavarga consists of the combinations of five letters: pa, pha, ba, bha,

and ma. These letters are the first letters of the words for five differ­

ent conditions as described below. The first letter, pa, comes from

the word pariibhava, which means "defeat." In this material struggle
for existence, we are simply meeting defeat. Actually, we have to

conquer birth, death, disease and old age, and because there is
no possibility of overcoming all these miserable conditions, due to
the illusion of miiyii, we are simply meeting with pariibhava, or de­

feat. The next letter, pha, is taken from the word phenila. Phenila is

the foam which is found on the mouth when one is very tired (as is
commonly observed with horses). The letter ba comes from the word

bandha, or bondage. Bha is taken from the word bhiti, or fearfulness.

Ma is taken trom the word mrti, or death. So the word pavarga

Bhiigavatam, Volume I, Chapter 3.

The Nectar of Devotion

signifies our struggle for existence and our meeting with defeat, ex­
haustion, bondage, fearfulness and, at last, death. Apavarga means
that which can nullify all of these material conditions. Kr9pa is said
to be the giver of apavarga, the path of liberation.

For the impersonalist and the enemies of Krwa, liberation means

to merge into the supreme. The demons and the impersonalists do
not care for Krwa, but Kr9pa is so kind that He gives this liberation
even to His enemies and to the impersonalists. There is the following
statement in this connection: "0 Murari [Kr9pa]! How wonderful
it is that although the demons, who were always envious of the demi­
gods, have failed to penetrate Your military phalanx, they have
penetrated the region of mitra, the sun globe." The word mitra is
used metaphorically. Mitra means the sun globe, and mitra also
means friend. The demons who opposed Kr9pa as enemies wanted to
penetrate His military phalanx; but instead of doing this, they died in
battle, and the result was that they penetrated the planet of Mitra, or.
the sun planet. In other words, they entered into the Brahman efful­
gence. The example of the sun planet is given here beca.use the sun is
ever-illuminating, like the spiritual sky, where there are innumerable
illuminating V aikuptha planets. The enemies of Kr9pa were killed,
and instead of penetrating Kr�pa 's phalanx, they entered into the
friendly atmosphere of the spiritual effulgence. That is the mercy of
Kr�pa, and therefore He is known as the deliverer of His enemies also.

60. The Attractor of Liberated Souls
There are many examples of how Kr�pa attracted even great lib­
erated souls like Sukadeva Gosvami and the Kumaras. In this connec­
tion the following statement was given by the Kumaras: "How won­
derful it is that although we are completely liberated, free from desire
and situated at the stage of paramaharhsa, we are still aspiring to
taste the pastimes of Radha and Kr�pa.

61. Performer of Wonderful Activities
In the Brhad- Viimana Puriir-a, the Lord says, "Although I have

Qualities of K[§[W Further Explained

196

many fascinating pastimes, whenever I think of the riisa-lilii, which

I perform with the gopis, I become eager to have it again."

One devotee has said, "I know about Naraya�a, the husband of the

goddess of fortune, and I also know about many other incarnations
of the Lord. Certainly all the pastimes of such incarnations are ex­

citing to my mind, but still, the pastimes of the riisa-lilii performed
by Lord Kr��a Himself are wonderfully increasing my transcendental
pleasure."
In the

Tenth

Canto,

31st

Chapter,

15th

verse, of Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, the gopis lament: "My dear Kr��a, during the daytime

when You go out into the forest of V rndavana with Your cows, we
consider one moment to be twelve years, and it is very difficult for us

to pass the time. And again when You come back at the end of the

day, by seeing Your beautiful face we are so much attracted that we

are unable to stop looking upon You constantly. At these times, when
there is occasional blinking of our eyelids, we condemn the creator,

Lord Brahma, as a dunce, because he does not know how to make

perfect eyes!" In other words, the gopis were disturbed by the blink­

ing of their eyes because for the moment that their eyes were closed

they could not see Kr��a. This means that the gopis' love for Kr��a

was so great and ecstatic that they were disturbed by even His mo­
mentary absence. And when they saw Kr��a, they. were also dis-

turbed. This is a paradox.

One gopi, expressing herself to Krwa, says: "When we meet You

at night, we consider the duration of night to be very small. And why

speak of only this night? Even if we had a night of Brahma * we

would consider it a very short time!" We get an idea of Brahma's

day from the following statement of the Bhagavad-gitii: "By human

calculation, a thousand yuga cycles taken together is Brahma's one
day. And such also is the duration of his night." (Bg. 8.17) The gopis

said that even if they could have that duration of night, it would still
not be sufficient for their meeting with Kr��a.

*

64,300,000,000 solar years equals twelve hours or one night of Brahma.

62. Kr§r-a's Attractive Flute
In the Tenth Canto, 35th Chapter, 8th verse of the Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, the gopis tell Mother Yasoda, "When your son plays on
His flute, Lord Siva, Lord Brahma and lndra-although they are sup­

posed to be the greatest learned scholars and personalities-all be­

come bewildered. Although they are all very great personalities, by

hearing the sound of Kr�!la's flute they humbly bow down and be­
come grave from studying the sound vibrated."

In his book Vidagdha-miidhava, Sri Rilpa Gosvami thus describes

the vibration of Kr�!ta's flute: "The sound yibration created by the

flute of Kr�!la wonderfully stopped Lord Siva from playing his lJir-­

l}ima drum, and the same flute has caused great sages like the four
Kumaras to become disturbed in their meditation. It has caused Lord

Brahma, who was sitting on the lotus flower for the creative function,

to become astonished. And Anantadeva, who was calmly holding all
the planets on his hood, was moving in this way and that due to the
transcendental

vibration

from

Kr�!la's

flute,

which

penetrated

through the covering of this universe and reached to the spiritual
sky."

63. Kr§r-a is Surrounded by Loving Devotees
When we speak of Kr�!la, Kr�!la is not alone. Kr�!la means His

name, His qualities, His fame, His friends, His paraphernalia, His

entourage-all of these are included. When we speak of a king, it is to
be understood that he is surrounded by ministers, secretaries, mili­

tary commanders and many other people. Similarly, Kr�!la is not

impersonal. In His Vrndavana lilii especially, He is surrounded by the

gopis, the cowherd boys, His father, His mother and all the inhabi­
tants of v rndavana.

64. Kr§r-a's Exquisite Beauty
In the Third Canto, 2nd Chapter, 12th verse, of Srimad-Bhiigavatam,
Uddhava tells Vidura, "My dear sir, Krwa's form was most wonder-

Qualities of Kr§rw Further Explained

198

ful when He appeared on this planet and exhibited the potency of
His internal energy. His wonderfully attractive form was present dur­
ing His pastimes on this planet, and by His internal potency He ex­
hibited His opulences, which are striking to everyone. His personal
beauty was so great that there was no necessity for His wearing orna­
ments on His body. In fact, instead of the ornaments beautifying
Kr�9-a, Kr�9-a 's beauty enhanced the ornaments."
Regarding the attractiveness of Kr�9-a's bodily beauty and the
sound vibration of His flute, in the Tenth Canto, 29th Chapter, 37th
verse, of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, the gopis address Kr�9-a as follows:

"Although our attitude towards You resembles loving affairs with a
paramour, we cannot but wonder at how no woman can maintain her
chastity upon hearing the vibration from Your flute. And not only
women, but even stronghearted men are subject to falling down from
their position at the sound of Your flute. In fact, we have seen that
in Vrndavana even the cows, the deer, the birds, the trees-everyone­
has been enchanted by the sweet vibration of Your flute and the
fascinating beauty of Your person."

In Riipa Gosvami's Lalita-miidhava, it is said: "One day Kr�9-a

happened to see the shadow of His beautiful form reflected on the
jeweled foreground. Upon seeing this bodily reflection, He expressed
His feelings: 'How wonderful it is that I have never seen such a beauti­
ful form! Although it is My own form, still, like Radharapi, I am
trying to embrace this form and enjoy celestial bliss."' This state­
ment shows how Krsna and His shadow reflection are one and the
.

.

.

.

same. There is no difference between Kr��a and His shadow re­
flection, nor between Krwa and His picture. That is the transcen­
dental position of Kr��a.
The above statements describe some of the wonderful reservoirs
of pleasure within Kr�9-a, as well as the transcendental qualities of
His personality. The transcendental qualities of Kr��a are compared
to the ocean: no one can estimate the length and breadth of the
ocean. But, as one can understand the ocean's contents simply by
testing one drop of it, so these statements will give us some under­
standing of Kr��a's transcendental position and qualities.

In the Tenth Canto, 14th Chapter, 7th verse, of Srimad-Bhiigavatam,

199

The Nectar of Devotion

Lord Brahmii says, "My dear Lord, the inconceivable qualities, beau­
ties and activities which You have revealed by Your presence on this
planet cannot be calculated by any material measurement. If one
even tries to ima gine that 'Kr�pa may be like this,' that is also impos­
sible. The day may come when the material scientist, after many,
many births or after many, many years, will be able to estimate the
atomic constitution of the whole world, or he may be able to count
the atomic fragments that permeate the sky, or he may even give an
estimate of all the atoms within the universe, but still he will never
be able to count the transcendental qualities in Your reservoir of
transcendental bliss."

23 I Kr��a's Personality

Srila Riipa Gosvami states that although Lord K{�l).a is the reser­

voir of unlimited pleasure and the greatest leader of all, He is still
dependent upon His devotees in three ways. According to the emo­

tional status of the devotee, the Supreme Personality of Godhead is

appreciated in three ways: as the most perfect, as very perfect and as
perfect. When He exhibits Himself in fullness, He is appreciated by

great learned scholars as most perfect. When He exhibits Himself in
lesser degrees, He. is called very perfect. And when He exhibits still
less, He is called perfect. This means that Krwa is appreciated for

three degrees cif perfection. These three degrees of perfection are

especially exhibited as follows: when He is in Goloka Vrndavana His

transcendental qualities are exhibited as most perfect, when He is in

Dvaraka He exhibits His qualities as very perfect, and when He is in
Mathura He exhibits His qualities as perfect.

Kr�l).a's personality is analyzed as dhirodiitta, dhira-lalita, dhira­

prasiinta and dhiroddhata. If one asks how a personality can be be­

held in four quite opposing ways, the answer is that the Lord is the

reservoir of all transcendental qualities and activities. Therefore, His
different aspects can be analyzed according to the exhibition of His
limitless variety of pastimes, and as such there is no contradiction.

Dhirodiitta
A dhirodiitta is a person who is naturally very grave, gentle, for­
giving, merciful, determined, humble, highly qualified, chivalrous and

bodily attractive.

200

The Nectar of Devotion

201

In this connection, the following statement given by lndra, the King

of heaven, is very significant: "My dear Lord, I admit that I have
committed great offenses unto You, but I cannot express my feelings

of regret, being bewildered at seemg Your extraordinary chivalrous
spirit, Your endeavor to protect Your devotees, Your determination,

Your steadiness in lifting the great Hill of Govardhana, Your beautiful

bodily features and Your astonishing characteristic of being pleased
simply by accepting the prayers of Your devotees and offenders."

The above statement by the King of heaven is an exact c�rrobora­

tion of Kr�!!a's being dhirodiitta. Many learned scholars have agreed

to also accept Lord Ramacandra as dhirodiitta, but all of Lord Rama­
candra's qualities are also included in the character of Lord Kr�!la.

Dhira-lalita
A person is called dhira-lalita if he is naturally very funny, always
in full youthfulness, expert in joking, and free from all anxieties. Such

a dhira-lalita personality is generally found to be domesticated and

very submissive to his lover. This dhira-lalita trait in the personality

of Krwa is described in Srimad-Bhiigavatam where Yajfiapatni, the

wife of one of the briihmar-as who were performing sacrifices in
Vrndavana, tells her friends: "One day Srimati Radharii!li, accompa­

nied by Her associates, was taking rest in Her garden, and at that time
Lord Sri Kr�!la arrived in that assembly. After sitting down, He began

to narrate very impudently about His previous night's pastimes with

Radhara!li. While He was speaking in that way, Radharii!li became

very embarrassed. She was feeling ashamed and was absorbed in
thought, and Kr�!la took the opportunity to mark Her breasts with

different kinds of tilaka. Kr�!la proved Himself to be very expert in

that art." In this way Kr�!la, as dhira-lalita, was enjoying His youthful

proclivities in the company of the gopis.

Generally, those who are expert in writing drama choose to call

Cupid

the ideal dhira-lalita, but we can more perfectly find in the

personality of Kr�!!a all the characteristics of dhira-lalita.

K[§[La's Personality

202

Dhira-prasiinta
A person who is very peaceful, forebearing, considerate and oblig­

ing is called dhira-prasiinta. This dhira-prasiinta trait of Kr�pa was
exhibited in His dealings with the PapQ.avas. On account of the
PapQ.avas' faithful devotion to the Lord, He agreed to become their
charioteer, their advisor, their friend, their messenger and sometimes
their bodyguard. Such is an example of the result of devotional ser­
vice towards Vi�pu. When Kr�pa was speaking to Maharaj Yudhi�thira
about religious principles, He demonstrated Himself to be a great
learned. scholar, but because He accepted the position of younger
cousin to Yudhi�thira, He was speaking in a very gentle tone which
enhanced His beautiful bodily features. The movements of His eyes
and the mode of His speech proved that He was very, very expert in
giving moral instruction. Sometimes, Maharaj Yudhi�thira is also ac­
cepted by learned scholars as dhira-prasiinta.

DhiroddhataA person who is very envious, proud, easily angered, restless and

complacent is called dhiroddhata by learned scholars. Such qualities
were visible in the character of Lord Kr�pa because, when He was
writing a letter to Kalayavana, Kr�pa addressed him as a sinful frog. In
His letter Kr�pa advised Kalayavana that he should immediately go
and find some dark well for his residence, because there was a black
snake named Kr�pa who was very eager to devour all such sinful frogs.
Krwa reminded Kalayavana that He could turn all the universes to

ashes simply by looking at them.
' The above statement by Kr�pa seems apparently to be of an en­

vious nature, but according to different pastimes, places and times
this quality is accepted as a great characteristic. Kr�pa's dhiroddhata
qualities have been accepted as great because Kr�pa uses them only
to protect His devotees. In other words, even undesirable traits may
also be used in the exchange of devotional service.

203

The Nectar of Devotion

Sometimes Bhima, the second brother of the Pa��avas, is also de­
scribed as dhiroddhata.
Once, while fighting with a demon who was appearing as a deer,
Kr��a challenged him in this way: "I have come before you as a
great elephant named Kr��a. You must leave the battlefield, accepting
defeat, or else there is death awaiting you." This challenging spirit of
Kr��a's is not contradictory to His sublime character because, as the
Supreme Being, everything is possible in His character.
There is a nice statement in the Kiirma Puriirw about these contra­
dictory traits of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. It is stated
there that the Supreme Person is neither very fat nor very thin; He is
always transcendental to material qualities, and yet His bodily luster
is blackish. His eyes are reddish, He is all-powerful, and He is equipped
with all different kinds of opulences. Contradictory traits in Kr��a's
person are not at all surprising: one should not consider the charac­
teristics of Krwa, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, to be actually
contradictory. One should try to understand the traits of Krwa from
authorities and try to understand how these characteristics are em­
ployed by the supreme will of the Lord.
In the Mahii-variiha Puriirw it is confirmed that the transcendental
bodies of the Supreme Personality of Godhead and His expansions
are all existing eternally. Such bodies are never material and are com­
pletely spiritual and full of knowledge. They are reservoirs of all
transcendental qualities. In the Vai§rz,ava Tantra there is a statement
that the Personality of Godhead and His expanded bodies are always
free from the eighteen kinds of material contaminations,* because
such bodies are always full of knowledge, bliss and eternity.
Regarding all of the above-mentioned statements, it is understood
that the Maha-Vi��u is the source of all incarnations in the material
world. But because of His greater extraordinary opulence, we can

*

The eighteen kinds of material contaminations mentioned above are described

in the Vi§rJu-yiimala Tantra as follows: illusion, fatigue, committing errors, rough­
ness, material lust, restlessness, pride, envy, violence, disgrace, exhaustion, untruth,
anger, hankering, dependence, desire to lord over the universe, seeing duality, and
cheating.

Kr�ra's Personality

understand that the son of Nanda Maharaj is the source of the Maha­
Visnu also. This is confirmed in the Brahma-samhitii, wherein it is
.

.

stated: "Let me offer my respectful obeisances unto Govinda, whose
partial representation is the Maha-Vi��u." The gigantic form of the
Maha-Vi��u is the source of generation for innumerable universes.
Innumerable universes are coming out of His exhaling breath, and the
same universes are going back in with His inhaling breath. This Maha­
Vi��u is also a plenary portion of a portion of Kr��a.

24 I Further Traits of Sri Krsna

•

After describing the different opulences of Kr�!J.a, S rila Riipa Go­
svaml tries to further describe the transcendental beauties and quali­

ties of the Lord as: decorated, enj oying, pleasing, dependable, steady

and predominating. He is also described as a meticulous dresser and a
magnanimous personality: These are generally considered to be the
qualities of great personalities.

Decorated
It is said that a person is great if he is decorated with the qualities
of being very merciful toward the unfortunate, very powerful, superi­
or, chivalrous, enthusiastic, expert and truthful. These decorations
were manifested in the character of Kr�!la during His Govardhana­
filii. At that time the whole tract of land in Vrndavana was being

disturbed by the rains sent by Indra, as described elsewhere above.
At first Kr�!la thought, "Let me retaliate against this vengeance of
Indra by destroying his heavenly kingdom," but later on, when He
thought of the insignificance of the King of heaven, Kr�!la changed
His mind and felt merciful toward Indra. No one is able to tolerate
the wrath of Kr�!J.a, so instead of retaliating against Indra, He simply
showed His compassion for His friends in Vrndavana by lifting the
whole of Govardhan Hill to protect them.

Enjoying
When a person is seen to be always happy and is accustomed to
205

Further Traits of Sri Kf§!W

206

speak smilingly, he is considered to be in the mode of enjoyment.

This trait was found in Krwa when He appeared at the sacrificial

arena of King Kamsa. It is described that the lotus-eyed Kr�pa en­

tered amongst the wrestlers without being impolite to them, glanced
over them with determination, and seemed to them just like ·an ele­

phant attacking some plants. Even while speaking to them, Kr�pa was

still smiling, and in this way He stood valiantly upon the wrestling

dais.

Pleasing
When one's characteristics are very sweet and desirable, his person­

ality is called pleasing. An example of Kr�pa's pleasing nature is thus

described in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam: "One day while Kr�pa was

awaiting the arrival of Srimati Radharapi by the bank of the Yamuna,

He began to make a garland of kadamba flowers. In the meantime,
Srimati Radhara!li appeared there, and at that time Murari [ Kr�!la],

the enemy of Mura, glanced over Radhara!li very sweetly."

Dependable
Any person who is reliable in all circumstances is called depend­

able. In this connection Riipa Gosvami says that even the demons

were relying upon the dependability of Kr�!la because they were con­

fident that Kr�!la would never attack them without due cause. There­

fore, with faith and confidence, they used to live with their doors

wide open. And the demigods, although afraid of the demons, were

confident of the protection of Krwa. Therefore, even in the midst of

danger they were engaged in sportive activities. Persons who had

never undergone the reformatory ritualistic ceremonies of the Vedas

were confident that Kr�!la would accept only faith and devotion, and

so they were engaged in Kr�!la consciousness and were freed from all

anxieties. In other words, all kinds of men, from the demigods down

to the uncultured, can rely on the causeless mercy of the Supreme
Lord.

The Nectar of Devotion

207

Steady
A person who is not disturbed even in a situation of reverses is
called steady. This steadiness was observed in Kr��a in connection
with His killing the demon known as Ba�a. The Ba�a demon had
many hands, and Kr��a was cutting off these hands one after another.
This Ba�a was a great devotee of Lord Siva and the goddess Durga.

Thus, when Ba�a was being killed, Lord Siva and Durga became very

furious at Krsna. But Krsna did not care for them.
. .

.

. .

.

Predominating
A person who can affect the mind of everyone is called predomi­
nating. As far as Kr��a's predomination is concerned, in the Tenth
Canto, 43rd Cha p ter, 14th verse, of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, Kr��a is de­
scribed thus by Sukadeva Gosvami to King Pan1qit: "My dear King,

Kr��a is a thunderbolt to the wrestlers; to the common man He is the

most beautiful human being; to the young girls He is just like Cupid;

to the cowherd men and women He is the most intimate relative; to
the impious kings He is the supreme ruler; to His parents, Nanda and

Y asoda, He is just a baby; to Kamsa, the King of Bhoja, He is death

personified; to the dull and stupid He is just like a stone; to the yogis

He is the supreme absolute truth; and to the Vr��is He is the Su­

preme Personality of Godhead. In such a predominating position
Kr��a appeared in that arena aldng with His older brother Balarama."
When Kr��a, the reservoir of all mellows, was present in the arena of
Kamsa, He appeared differently to the different persons who were

related to Him in different mellows. It is stated in the Bhagavad-gitii

that He appears to every person according to one's relationship with
Him.

Sometimes learned scholars describe' "predominating" to mean

a person intolerant of being neglected. This peculiarity in Kr��a was
visible when Kamsa was insulting Maharaj Nanda, and Vasudeva ask­
ing Kr��a's assistance in killing Kamsa. Kr��a was glancing over Kamsa

with longing eyes, just like a prostitute, and He was just preparing to
jump at the King.

..

Further Traits of Sri K[§rla

208

Meticulous Dresser
A person who is very fond of dressing Himself is called lalita, or a

meticulous dresser. This characteristic was found in Krsna in two
ways: sometimes He used to decorate Srimati Radharii!J.i �-th various

marks, and sometimes, when He was preparing to kill demons like
Ari�tasura, He would take care to arrange His belt very nicely.

Magnanimous
Persons who can give themselves to anyone are called magnani­

mous. No one could be �ore magnanimous than Kr�!la because He is

always prepared to give Himself completely to His devotee. Even to
one who is not a devotee, Kr�!la in His form of Lord Caitanya is pre­

pared to give Himself and to grant deliverance.

Although Kr�!la is independent of everyone, out of His causeless

mercy He is dependent upon Garga ��i for religious instruction; for
learning the military art He is dependent upon Satyaki; and for good
counsel He is dependent upon His friend, Uddhava.

25 I Devotees of Krsna
•

•

•

A person who is always absorbed in Kr9�a consciousness is called a

devotee of Kr9�a. S rila Riipa Gosvami says that all the transcendental
qualities discussed above are also found in the devotees of Kr9pa. The
devotees of Kr9�a can be classified into two groups: those who are

cultivating devotional service in order to enter into the transcendental
kingdom, and those who are already in the perfectional stage of devo­
tional service.
A person who has attained the stage of attraction for Kr9pa and

who is not freed from the material impasse, but who has qualified
himself to enter into the kingdom of God, is called siidhaka. Siidhaka

means one who is cultivating devotion in Krwa consciousness. The
description of such a devotee is found in the Eleventh Canto, 2nd
Chapter, 45th verse, of Srimad-Bhiigavatam. It is said there that a per­

son who has unflinching faith in and love for the Personality of God­
head, who is in friendship with devotees of Krwa, and who is very
merciful to the ignorant, raising them to the standard of devotional

I

I

service, and who is uninterested in nondevotees, is considered to be
situated in the position of cultivating devotional service.
When one is found shedding tears by hearing of the pastimes of the
Lord, it is to be understood that the blazing fire of material existence
will be extinguished by such watering. When there is shivering of the
body and the hairs of the body stand up, it is to be understood that
the devotee is nearing perfection. An example of a siidhaka cultivating
devotional service is Bilvamangala Thakur.
When a person is never tired of executing devotional service and is
always engaged in Kr9�a conscious activities, constantly relishing the
209

Devotees of K[§[W

210

transcendental mellows in relationship with .i(r�l).a, the devotee is
called perfect. This perfectional stage can be achieved in two ways:
one may achieve this stage of perfection by gradual progress in de­
votional service, or one may become perfect by the causeless mercy
of Kr�l).a, even though he has not executed all the details of devotional
service. There is the following nice statement in the Third Canto,

15th Chapter, 25th verse, of Srimad-Bhiigavatam describing a devotee

who achieves perfection by regularly executing devotional service: A
person who is freed from the false egotism of material existence, or
an advanced mystic, is eligible to enter into the kingdom of God
known as V aikul).tha. Such a mystic becomes so joyful by constant
execution of the regulative principles of devotional service that he
thereby achieves the special favor of the Supreme Lord. Y amaraja,
the mighty superintendent of death, is afraid to go near such a devo­
tee; so we can imagine the potency of advanced devotional service,
especially when devotees sit together and engage in talking of the
pastimes of the Supreme Personality of Godhead. Those devotees ex­
press their feelings in such a way that they automatically melt with
ecstasy, and many transcendental symptoms become manifested in
their bodies. Anyone desiring advancement in devotional service must
follow in the footsteps of such devotees.

_)

Prahlad Maharaj said that no one can attain the perfectional stage
of devotional service without bowing down before exalted devotees.
Learned sages like Markal).�eya ij,�i attained perfection in devotional
service simply by executing such regulative principles of service.

A person's achieving perfection in devotional service simply by the

causeless mercy of the Lord is explained in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam

in connection with the briihmar-as and their wives who were engaged
in performing yajna, or sacrifice. When the wives of the briihmar-as

were favored by Lord Kr�!la and immediately attained the ecstasy of
love of Godhead, their husbands began to say, "How wonderful it is
that although these women have undertaken no reformatory per­
formances such as accepting the sacred thread, have not resided in
the monastaries of the spiritual master, have not observed the strict
principles of celibacy, have not undergone any austerities, nor philoso­
phized upon the observance of all ritualistic ceremonies-they still

211

The Nectar of Devotion

have attained the favor of Krwa, which is aspired after even by great
mystics! How wonderful it is that these women have attained such
perfection, while we, although briihmar-as who have performed all
the reformatory activities, cannot attain to this advanced stage!"

There is a similar statement by Narada, addressed to S ukadeva Go­

svami: "My dear S ukadeva Gosvami, you never took the trouble to
reside under the care of a spiritual master, and yet you have attained
such a great status of transcendental knowledge. You never took the
trouble to undergo severe austerities, and still, how wonderful it is
that you have been situated in the most perfect stage of love of God­
head."

S ukadeva Gosvami and the wives of the briihmar-as who were

performing yajiia are vivid examples of devotees who achieved the
perfectional stage of devotional service by the grace of the Supreme
Personality of Godhead.
Eternal Perfection

Persons who have achieved eternal, blissful life exactly on the level
of S ri Kr��a, and who are able to attract Lord Kr��a by their tran­
scendental loving service, are called eternally perfect. The technical
name is nitya-siddha. There are two classes of living entities-namely,
nitya-siddha and nitya-baddha. The distinction is that the nitya­
siddhas are eternally Kr��a conscious without any forgetfulness,
whereas the nitya-baddhas, or eternally conditioned souls, are forget­

ful of their relationship with Kr��a.
The position of the nitya-siddhas is explained in the Padma Puriir-a
in connection with the narration of the Supreme Personality of God­
head and Satyabhamadevi. The Lord tells Satyabhama: "My dear
Satyabhamadevi, I have descended to this earthly planet by the re­
quest of Lord Brahma and other demigods. Those who are born into
this family of Yadu are all My eternal associat.es. My dear wife, you
should not consider that My associates are ever separated from Me;
they are My personal expansions, and as such, you must know that
they are almost as powerful as I am. Because of their transcendental
qualities, they are very, very dear to Me, as I am very, very dear 'to

Devotees of K[§!W

212

them." Anyone who becomes exhilarated by hearing of the pastimes
of Lord Kr�!la when He was present on this earth with His associates
is to be understood as nitya-siddha, eternally perfect.
In

the

Tenth

Canto,

14th

Chapter,

30th verse,

of Srimad­

Bhiigavatam there is the statement: "How wonderful are the fortunate
residents of Vrndavana, such as Nanda and the other cowherd men.

The Supreme Personality of Godhead, the supreme Brahman, has ac­

tually become their intimate friend!"
A similar statement is there in the Tenth Canto, 26th Chapter,

lOth verse, of Srimad-Bhiigavatam. When Lord Kr�!la lifted Govardhan
Hill, the cowherd men, under the protection of Lord Kr�!la, became
struck with wonder and went to Nanda Maharaj and inquired from
him, "My dear Nanda Maharaj , how is it that we are so intensely
attached to Kr�!la, and Kr�!la is also so affectionately attached to us?
Does it mean that He is the supersoul of everyone?"
All of the residents of Vrndavana and Dvaraka-namely the cow­
herd men and the members of the Yadu family-are eternally perfect
devotees of the Lord. As the Lord descends by His causeless mercy
upon this planet, so, in order to help in the pastimes of the Lord,
these devotees also come here. They are not ordinary living entities
or conditioned souls; they are ever-liberated persons, associates of the
Personality of Godhead. And, j ust as Lord Kr�!la behaves like an or­
dinary man when He descends to this planet, so the members of the
Yadu dynasty and the residents of Vrndavana execute activities j ust
like ordinary men. But they are not ordinary men; they are as liber­
ated as Lord Kr�!la Himself.

In the Padma Puriirw, Uttara-khar-{ia section, it is stated: "Just as

Lord Ramacandra descends along with Lak�ma!la and Bharata, an ex­
pansion of Sankar�a!la, *so the members of the Yadu dynasty and the
cowherd men of Vrndavana also descend with Lord Kr�!la in order to

j oin in the transcendental pastimes of the Lord. When the Supreme
Lord returns to His eternal abode, His associates return with Him to

tions of Godhead are developed is to be fouml in the author's Teachings of Lord

Chaitanya (New York: 1968) in Chapters VI, VII and XIII.

their respective places. As such, these ever liberated Vai§rzavas are not
bound by the material laws of birth and death."
As is stated in the Bhagavad-gitii by the Lord Himself, His birth,
deeds and activities are all transcendental. Similarly, the birth, deeds
and activities of the associates of the Lord are also transcendental.
And, as it is an offense to consider oneself to be Kr��a, so it is offen­
sive to consider oneself to be Y asoda, Nanda, or any other associate
of the Lord. We should always remember that they are transcen­
dental; they are never conditioned souls.
It is described that Kr��a, the enemy of Kamsa, has sixty-four tran­
scendental qualities, and all of the ever-liberated souls who accom­
pany the Lord have the first fifty-five of the qualities, without any
doubt. Such devotees are related to the Supreme Personality of God­
head in any of five transcendental mellows-namely, neutrality, servi­
torship, friendship, parenthood and conj ugal love. These relation­
ships with the Lord are eternal, and therefore nitya-siddha devotees
do not have to strive to attain the perfectional stage by executing
regulative devotional principles. They are eternally qualified to serve
Kr��a.

26 I Stimulation for Ecstatic Love

Some things which give stimulation to ecstatic love of Knn;a are
His transcendental qualities, His uncommon activities, His smiling fea­
tures, His apparel, His garlands, His flute, His buffalo horn, His leg
bells, His conchshell, His footprints, His place of pastimes (such as
Vrndavana), His favorite plant (tulasi), His devotee and the periodical
occasions for remembering Him. One such occasion for remembrance
is Ekiidasi, which comes twice a month on the eleventh day of the
moon, both waning and waxing. On that day all the devotees remain
fasting throughout the night and continually chant the glories of the
Lord.

K[§[ta's Transcendental Qualities, His Uncommon Activities
and His Smile
As far as Kr�!la's transcendental qualities are concerned, they can
be divided into three groups: qualities pertaining to His transcen­
dental body, qualities pertaining to His transcendental speech, and
qualities pertaining to His transcendental mind.
Kr�!la's age, His transcendental bodily features, His beauty, and
His mildness are qualities pertaining to His body. There is no differ­
ence between Kr�!la and His body, and therefore the transcendental
features pertaining to His body are the same as Kr�!la Himself. But
because these qualities stimulate the devotee's ecstatic love, they have
been analyzed as separate causes of that love. To be attracted by the
qualities of Kr�!la means to be attracted by Kr�!la Himself, because
there is no real distinction between Krwa and His qualities. Kr�!la's
214

215

The Nectar of Devotion

name is also Kr��a. Kr��a's fame is also Kr��a. Kr��a's entourage is

also Kr��a. Kr��a and everything related with Krwa which gives
stimulation to love of Kr��a are all Krwa, but for our understanding

these items can be considered separately.

Kr��a is the reservoir of all transcendental pleasure. Therefore, the

impetuses to love of Kr��a, although seemingly different, are not ac­

tually distinct from Kr��a Himself. In the technical Sanskrit terms,

such qualities as Kr��a's name, fame, etc., are accepted both as reser­
voirs of and stimulation for love of Krwa.

Kr��a's age is considered in three periods: from His appearance day

to the end of His sixth year is called kaumiira; from the beginning of
the sixth year up to the tenth year is called paugarz�a; and from the
tenth to the sixteenth year is called kaisora; after the beginning of the

sixteenth year, Kr��a is called a yauvana or a youth, and this con­

tinues with no change.

As far as Kr��a's transcendental pastimes are concerned, they are

mostly executed during the kaumiira, paugarz4a and kaisora periods.

His affectionate pastimes with His parents are executed during His

kaumiira age. His friendship with the cowherd boys _is exhibited dur­

ing the paugarz�a period. And His friendship with the gopis is exhib­

ited during the age of kaisora. Kr��a's pastimes at Vrndavana are
finished by the end of His fifteenth year, and then He is transferred

to Mathura and Dvaraka, where all other pastimes are performed.

Snia Rupa Gosvami gives us a vivid description of Kr��a as the

reservoir of all pleasures in his Bhakti-rasiimrta-sindhu. Here are some

parts of that description.

Kr��a's kaisora age can be divided into three parts. In the beginning

of His kaisora age-that is, at the beginning of His eleventh year, the
luster of His body becomes so bright that it becomes an impetus for

ecstatic love. Similarly, there are reddish borders around His eyes,

and a growth of soft hairs on His body. In describing this early stage

of His kaisora age, Kundalata, one of the residents of Vrndavana, said

to her friend, "My dear friend, I have just seen an extraordinary

beauty appearing in the person of Kr��a. His blackish bodily hue
appears just like the indranua jewel. There are reddish signs on His

eyes, and small soft hairs are coming out on His body. The appear-

Stimulation for Ecstatic Love

216

ance of these symptoms has made Him extraordinarily beautiful."

In this connection, in the Tenth Canto, 21st Chapter, 5th verse, of

Srimad-Bhagavatam, Sukadeva Gosvam1 tells King Parlk�it: "My dear

King, I shall try to describe how the minds of the gopis became ab­

sorbed in the thought of Kr�t;ta. The gopis would meditate on Kr�t;ta's

dressing Himself just like a dancing actor and entering the forest of
Vrndavana, marking the ground with His footprints. They meditated

on Kr�t;ta's having a helmet with a peacock feather and wearing ear­

rings on His ears and yellow-gold colored garments covered with

jewels and pearls. They also meditated on Kr�t;ta's blowing His flute
and on all the cowherd boys' singing of the glories of the Lord."

That is the description of the meditati'on which the gopis used to

perform.

Sometimes the gopis would think about His soft nails, moving eye­

brows and His teeth, which were catechu colored from chewing pan.

One description was given by a gopi to her friend: "My dear friend,

just see how the enemy of Agha has assumed such wonderful fea­

tures! His brows are just like the brows of Cupid, and they are

moving just as· though they were dancing. The tips of His nails are so
soft-it is as if they were dried bamboo leaves. His teeth are reddish,

and so it appears that He has assumed a feature of anger. Under the

circumstances, where is the chance for a young girl not to be at­

tracted by such beautiful features and not to be afraid of becoming a
victim to such beauty?"

Kr�t;ta's attractive features are also described by Vrndii, the gopi af­

ter whom Vrndavana was named. She told Kr�t;ta: "My dear Madhava,
Your newly-invented smile has so captivated the hearts of the gopis

that they are simply unable to express themselves! As such, they have

become bewildered and will not talk with others. All of these gopis

have become so affected that it is as if they had offered three sprin­

kles of water upon their lives. In other words, they have given up all

hope for their living condition." According to the Indian system,

when a person is dead there is a sprinkling of water on the body.
Thus, the statement of Vrnda shows that the gopis were so enchanted

by the beauty of Krwa that because they could not express their
minds, they decided to commit suicide.

217

The Nectar of Devotion

When Kn;�a arrived at the age of thirteen to fourteen years, His

two arms and chest assumed an unspeakable beauty, and His whole

form became simply enchanting. When Kr��a attained thirteen years

of age, His two arms were challenging the trunks of elephants, His
rising chest was trying to come to peace talks with doors of jewels,
and His two arms were minimizing the value of the bolts found on

doors. Who can describe the wonderful beauty of these features of

Kr��a? The special beauty of Kr��a's body was His mild smiling, His

restless eyes and His world-enchanting songs. These are the special
features of this age.

There is a statement in this connection that Kr��a, on arriving at

this age, manifested such beautiful bodily features that His restless

eyes became the playthings of Cupid, and His mild smile resembled

the newly-grown lotus flower. The enchanting vibration of His songs
became a great impediment to the young girls, who were supposed to

remain chaste and faithful to their husbands.

At this age Kr��a enjoyed the riisa-lilii, exhibiting His power of

joking with the cowherd girls and enjoying their company in the

bushes of the gardens by the bank of the Yamuna.

In this connection there is the following statement: "Throughout
the whole tract of land known as Vrndavana there were the foot­
prints of Kr��a and the gopis, and in some places peacock feathers

were strewn about. In some places there were nice beddings in the
bushes of the Vrndavana gardens, and in some places there were piles
of dust due to the group-dancing of Govinda and the gopis." These

are some of the features which are due to the different pastimes in­

vented by Sri Kr��a in the place known as Vrndavana.

There is the following statement by one gopi, describing Kr��a's
attractive feature during this age: "My dear friend, just see how all of

a sudden in the sky of Kr��a there is a powerful rising sun and how

this rising sun is minimizing the rays of our chastity moon. Our at­

traction for Kr��a is so intense that it is drying up the lotus flower of
our discrimination, and we are losing our senses in deciding whether

we shall continue as chaste women or be victimized by the beauty of
Kr��a. My dear friend, I think that we have lost all hope of life!"
In the kaisora age, beginning from the eleventh year and con-

Stimulation for Ecstatic Love

218

tinuing up to the end of the fifteenth year, Kr�l)a's arms, legs and
thighs became marked with three divisional lines. At that time
Kr�l)a's chest challenged the hill of the marakata jewel. His arms chal­
lenged the pillars of the indranila jewel, the three lines of His waist
challenged the waves of the River Yamuna, and His thighs challenged
beautiful bananas. One gopi said, "With all these exquisite features of
His body, Kr�l)a is too extraordinarily beautiful, and therefore I am
always thinking of Him to protect me because He is the killer of all
demons."
The idea expressed in this statement is that the gopis were com­
paring their attraction for Kr�t;la to an attack by demons; and to
counteract their attraction for the beauty of Kr�l)a, they were also
turning to Kr�t;la hopefully, because He is the killer of all kinds of
demons. In other words they were perplexed because on one hand
they were attracted by the beauty of Kr�l)a, and on the other they
needed Kr�t;la to drive away the demon of such attraction.
This kaisora age can be translated as adolescence. At the end of
this period all the gopis said, "Kr�l)a is the killer of the attraction of
Cupid, and as such He disturbs the patience of all newly-married
girls. Krwa's bodily features have become so exquisite-it is as if they
are all manifesting an artistic sense of the highest sort. His dancing
eyes have dimmed the brilliance of the most expert dancer, and so
there is no longer any comparison to the beauty of Kr�l)a." Learned
scholars therefore describe the features of His body at this time as
nava-yauvana, newly-invented youthfulness. At this stage of Kr�t;la's

bodily features, the conjugal love affairs with the gopis and similar
pastimes become very prominent.
There are six features of conjugal love affairs, called peacemaking,
picking a quarrel, going to meet one's lover, sitting together, separa­
tion and support. Lord Kr�l)a expanded an empire of these six fea­
tures, of which He was the ruling prince. Somewhere He was picking
quarrels with the young girls, somewhere He was scratching them
with the nails of parrots, somewhere He was busy going to visit the
gopis, and somewhere He was negotiating through cowherd friends to

take shelter of the gopis.
Some of the gopis addressed Him thusly: "My dear Kr�l)a, because

219

I

I

I
1:I

The Nectar of Devotion

of Your adolescent age, You have just become the spiritual master of
these young girls, and You are teaching them to whisper among them­
selves. You are teaching them to offer solemn prayers, as well as
training them to cheat their husbands and to join You in the gardens
at night, without caring for the instructions of their superiors. You
are enthusing them by the vibration of Your enchanting flute; and,
as their teacher, You are teaching them all the intricacies of loving
affairs."
It is said that even when Kr�l!a was a boy of five He manifested
such youthful energies, but learned scholars do not explain them be­
cause of the absence of suitable age. Kr�l!a was beautiful because
every part of His body was perfectly arranged without any defect.
Such perfect bodily features of Kr�l!a are described as follows: "My
dear enemy of Kamsa, Your broad eyes, Your rising chest, Your two
pillar-like arms and the thin middle portion of Your body are always
enchanting to every lotus-eyed beautiful girl." The ornaments on the
body of Kr�l!a were not actually enhancing His beauty, but just the
reverse-the ornaments were beautified by Kr�!la.
A person is called mild when he cannot even bear the touch of the
most soft thing. It is described that every part of Krwa's body was so
soft that even at the touch of newly-grown leaves, the color of the
touched part of His skin would change. At this kaisora age, Kr�!!a's
endeavors were always bent toward arranging the rasa dance, as well
as toward killing the demons in the forest of Vrndavana. While Kr�!la
was engaged in enjoyment with the boys and girls within the forest
of Vrndavana, Kamsa used to send his associates to kill Him, and
Kr�!la would show His prowess by killing them.

Kr§rta's Apparel and Garlands
Generally, there are four kinds of garments on the body of Kr�!la:
His shirt, turban, belt and wearing garments. In Vrndavana, He used
to put on reddish garments, with a golden shirt on His body and an
orange colored turban on His head. The different kinds of belts, com­
bined with His enchanting smile, used to always increase the tran­
scendental bliss of His associates. This dress of Krwa is described

Stimulation for Ecstatic Love

220

as gorgeous. As a baby elephant is sometimes dressed in colorful
clothing, so Krwa's gorgeousness was manifested by decoration with
such colorful clothing on the different parts of His body.

A kalpa refers to the texture of Kr�:p.a's hair, His nicely dressed
body annointed with sandalwood pulp and decorated with flower
garlands, His tilaka, and His chewing pan. Kr�:p.a was decorated con­
stantly in this iikalpa process. Kr�:p.a's hair was sometimes decorated
with flowers placed on the middle of His head, or else reaching down
to His back. In this way Kr�:p.a dressed His hair differently at different
times. As for the ointment on His body, the pulp of sandalwood gen­
erally appeared to be white, and when it was mixed with saffron dye
it appeared to be yellow.
Kr�:p.a used to put a vaijayanti garland around His neck. This vai­
jayanti garland is made of at least five differently colored flowers.
The length of such a garland was always touching Kr�:p.a's knees or
feet. Besides this garland of flowers, there were other kinds of flower
garlands too-sometimes decorating His head, sometimes hanging
around His neck and chest. Artistic painting with sandalwood pulp
and colored sandalwood were also to be found on the body of Kr�:p.a.
One gopi addressed her friend and began to praise the bodily
feat'.lres of Kr�:p.a. She praised His blackish complexion, the reddish
color of chewing pan enhancing His beauty hundreds of times, the
curling hair on His head, the kunkum * red spots on His body and the
tilaka on His forehead.
His helmet, His earrings, His necklace, His four garments, the ban­
gles on His head, the rings on His fingers, His ankle bells and His
flute-these are the different features of Krsna's ornaments. Krsna,
.

.

.

.

.

.

the enemy of Agha, always looked beautiful with His incomparable
helmet, His earrings made of diamonds, His necklace of pearls, His
bangles, embroidered garments and the beautiful rings on His fingers.
Kr�:p.a is sometimes called vanamiili. Vana means forest and mali
means gardener, so vanamiili refers to one who extensively uses flow* KU1ikum is a sweetly-flavored reddish powder which is thrown on the bodies of
worshipahle persons_

221

The Nectar of Devotion

ers and garlands on different parts of His body. Kr�r;Ia was dressed
like this not only in Vrndavana but also on the battlefield of Kuruk·
�etra. Seeing such colorful dress and the garlands of different flowers,
some great sages prayed, "Lord Kr�9:a was going to the battlefield of
Kuruk�etra not to fight, but to grace all of the devotees with His
presence."
K[§!"a's Flute

As far as His flute is concerned, it is said that the vibration of this
wonderful instrument was able to break the meditation of the great·
est sages, and Kr�r;Ia was thus challenging Cupid by advertising His
transcendental glories all over the world.
There are three kinds of flutes used by Kr�r;J.a. One is called ve rz u ,
one

is called murali, and the third is called varhsi. Ve!"u is very small,

not more than six inches long, with six holes for whistling. Murali is
about eighteen inches long with a hole at the end and four holes on
the body of the flute. This kind of flute produces a very enchanting
sound. The varhsi flute is about fifteen inches long, with nine holes
on its body. Kr�r;Ia used to play on these three flutes occasionally
when they were needed. Kr�r;J.a has a longer varhsi, which is called
mahiinanda, or sanmohini. When it is still longer it is called iikar§ini.

When it is even longer it is called iinandini. The iinandini flute is very
pleasing to the cowherd boys and is technically named varhsuli. These
flutes were sometimes bedecked with jewels. Sometimes they were
made of marble and sometimes of hollow bamboo. When the flute is
made of jewels it is called sanmohini. When made of gold, it is called
iikar§ini.
K[§!!a's Buffalo Horn

Kr�r;Ia used a buffalo horn as a bugling instrument. This instrument
was always highly polished and circled with gold bands, and on the
middle there was a hole. Regarding these instruments, there is a
metaphorical statement about a gopi named Taravali. It is said that
Taravali became bitten by the most venomous snake of Krwa's flute.

Stimulation for Ecstatic Love

222

Then, in order to neutralize the poisonous effect, she drank the milk
produced by the buffalo horn in the hand of Kn;�a. But instead of

decreasing the poisonous effect, it increased it a thousand times. The

gopi was thus put into the most miserable poisoned condition.
The Attraction of Kr§r-a's Leg Bells

A certain gopi once stated to her friend, "My dear friend, when I
heard the sound of the leg bell of Sri Kr��a, I immediately started to

go out of the house to see Him. But most regrettably, my superiors
were present just before me at that time, and I could not go out."

Kr§r-a's Conchshell
Kr��a's conchshell is known as Paiicajanya. This Paiicajanya conch

is also mentioned in the Bhagavad-gitii. Kr��a sounded it before the

Battle of Kuruksetra. It is said that when Lord Krsna blows on His
.

.

.

.

transcendental conchshell, the wives of the demons become subject
to abortions, and the wives of the demigods become blest with all

auspiciousness. In this way, the sound of Kr��a's conchshell used to

vibrate and circulate all over the world.

Kr§r-a's Footprints
It is stated in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam that when Akriira, who
drove Kr��a from Vrndavana to Mathura, saw the footprints of Kr��a
on the land of Vrndavana, his ecstatic love for Kr��a increased so
much that the hairs on his body stood up. His eyes became over­

flooded with tears, and in such ecstasy he jumped out of the chariot

and fell down on the ground and began to chant, "How wonderful

this is! How wonderful this is!"

Similar feelings were expressed by the gopis when they were going

to the bank of the Yamuna and saw Kr��a's footprints in the dust.

When Krwa walked on the ground of Vrndavana, the marks of His

sole (flag, thunderbolt, fish, a rod for controlling elephants and lotus
flower) would be imprinted upon the dust of the land. The gopis be-

223

The Nectar of Devotion

came overwhelmed simply at seeing those marks on the ground.
Knrw 's Places of Pastimes

One devotee has exclaimed, "Oh, I have not as yet visited the won­
derful places where the pastimes of the Lord were performed. But
simply by hearing the name of Mathura I have become overwhelmed
with joy!"
K[§rta's Favorite Plant: Tulasi

Lord Kr�l)a is very fond of tulasi leaves and buds. Because tulasi

buds are usually offered up to the lotus feet of Kr�l)a, a devotee once

prayed to the tulasi buds to give him some information about the

lotus feet of the Lord. The devotee expected that the tulasi buds

would know something about the glories of Lord Sri Kr�l)a's lotus

feet.
K[§[W 's Devotees

One may sometimes become overwhelmed with joy by seeing a

devotee of the Lord. When Dhruva Maharaj saw two associates of
Narayal)a approaching him, he immediately stood up out of sincere

respect and devotion and remained before them with folded hands;
but because of his ecstatic love he could hardly offer them a proper
reception.
There is a statement by a gopi who addressed Subala, a friend of
Kr�l)a: "My dear Subala, I know that Krwa is your friend and you
always enjoy smiling and joking with Him. The other day I saw you
both standing together, and you were keeping your hand upon
Kr�l)a's shoulder, and both of you were joyfully smiling. When I saw

the two of you standing like that in the distance, my eyes at once
became overflooded with tears."
Special Days for Remembering K[§[W

There are many statements about the festive days in connection

Stimulation for Ecstatic Love

224

with Krgta's different activities. One of these festive days is .Janmii§­

tami, the day of Kr��a's birth. This ]anmii§tami Day is the most
opulent festival day for the devotees, and it is still observed with
great pomp in every Hindu house in India. Sometimes even the devo­
tees of other religious groups take advantage of this auspicious day
and enj oy the performance of the ceremony of ]an mii§ t am i. Ecstatic
love for Kr��a is also aroused on the days of Ekiidasi, which are other
festive days in connection with Kr��a.

27 I Symptoms of Ecstatic Love

The bodily symptoms which are manifested by a devotee in ex­

pressing ecstatic love for Krwa are called anubhiiva. Practical exam­
ples of anubhiiva are as follows: dancing, rolling on the ground,

singing very loudly, stretching the body, crying loudly, yawning,

breathing very heavily, neglecting the presence of others, drooling,

laughing like a madman, wheeling the head and belching. When there
is an extraordinary excess of ecstatic love, with all of these bodily
symptoms manifested, one feels relieved transcendentally.

These symptoms are divided into two parts: one is called sita, and

the other is called k§epar;w. When there is yawning, it is called sita,
and when there is dancing it is called k§epar-a.

Dancing
While watching the riisa dance performed by Lord Knn;ta and the

gopis, Lord Siva beheld the beautiful face of Krwa and immediately
began to dance and beat upon his small �irt�ima drum. While Lord

Siva wa!'l dancing in ecstasy, his eldest son, Gane8a, joined him.

Rolling on the Ground
In the Third Canto, lst Chapter, 31st verse, of Snmad-Bhiigavatam,

Vidura inquires from Uddhava, "My dear friend, is Akriira in an aus­

picious condition? He is not only a learned scholar and sinless, but he
is also a devotee of Lord Krsna. He has such ecstatic love for Krsna
.

.

.

.

.

.

that I have seen him rolling upon Kr�!la 's footprints in the dust as if
225

Symptoms of Ecstatic Love

226

bereft of all senses." Similarly, one gopi gave a message to Kr��a that

Radhara�i, because of Her separation from Him and because of Her

enchantment with the flavor of His flower garlands, was rolling on
the ground, thereby bruising Her soft body.
Singing Loudly
One gopiinformed Kr��a that when Srimati Radhara�i was singing

about His glories, She enchanted all of Her friends in such a way that

they became stonelike and dull. At the same time, the nearby stones

began to melt away in ecstatic love.
Stretching the Body

When there was stretching of the body of Narada Muni from

chanting the Hare Kr��a mantra, he chanted so loudly that it was

apprehended that Lord Nrsimha had appeared. Thus all the demons
began to flee in different directions. It is also said that sometimes

when Narada, the carrier of the vir-a, remembers his Lord Kr��a in
great ecstasy, he begins to stretch his body so vigorously that his
,
sacred thread gives way.
Crying Loudly
A gopi once said to Kr��a: "My dear son of Nanda Maharaj, by the

sound of Your flute Srimati Radhara�i has become full of lamenta­
tion and fear, and thus, with faltering voice, She is crying like a
kurobi bird.

It is described that by hearing the vibration of Krwa 's flute Lord

Siva becomes very puzzled and begins to cry so loudly into space

that the demons become vanquished and the devotees become over­
whelmed with joy.

Yawning
It is said that when the full moon rises, the lotus petals become

227

The Nectar of Devotion

expanded. Similarly, when Kr�!la used to appear before Radhara!li,
Her face, which is compared with the lotus flower, would expand by
Her yawning.

Breathing Heavily
As far as breathing heavily is concerned, it is stated: "Lalita [one
of the gopis] is just like a cutakibird, which only takes water falling
directly from the rain cloud and not from any other source." In this
statement Kr�!la is compared to the dark cloud, and Lalita is com­
pared to the cutaki bird seeking only Kr�!la's company. The meta­
phor continues to say, "As a heavy wind sometimes disperses a
mighty cloud, so the heavy breath from Lalita's nostrils caused her
to miss Krwa, who had disappeared by the time she recovered her­
self."

Neglecting the Presence of Others
As far as neglecting the presence of others is concerned, the wives
of the bruhmar-as who were performing sacrifices at V rndavana left
home as soon as they heard that Kr�!la was nearby. They left their
homes without caring for their learned husbands. The husbands be­
gan to discuss this amongst themselves: "How wonderful is the at­
traction for Kr�!la, that it has made these women leave us without
any care!" This is the influence of Krwa. Anyone who becomes at­
tracted to Kr§'!la can be relieved from the bondage of birth and death,
which can be compared to the locked-up homes that were neglected
by the wives of the bruhmar-as.
In the Padyuvali there is a statement by some devotees: "We shall
not care for any outsiders. If they should deride us, we shall still not
care for them. We shall simply enjoy the transcendental mellow of
chanting Hare Kr§'!la, and thus we shall roll on the ground and dance
ecstatically. In this way we shall eternally enjoy transcendental bliss."

Drooling
As an example of the running down of saliva from the mouth, it

Symptoms of Ecstatic Love

228

is stated that sometimes when Narada Muni was chanting the Hare

Kr��a mantra, he remained stunned for awhile, and saliva oozed from
his mouth.

Laughing like a Madman
When a devotee laughs very loudly like a madman, it is done out
of an extraordinary agitation of ecstatic love within the heart. Such
mad laughing is an expression of the condition of the heart, which is
technically called afta-hiisa. When a devotee becomes affected with
this mental condition, his love is expressed through the lips. The

laughing sounds, coming one after another, are compared to flowers
falling from the creeper of devotion which grows within the heart of

the devotee. In the Caitanya-caritiimrta devotional service to the
Lord is also compared to a creeper which rises up to the lotus feet of

Kr��a in Goloka Vrndavana.

Wheeling of the Head
One gopi told her friend: "It appears that Lord Kr��a, the enemy

of the demon Agha, has released from His mouth a whirlwind which

is acting on your head and is gradually proceeding to do the same to
the other lotus-eyed go pis."

Belching
Sometimes belching also becomes a symptom of ecstatic love for

Kr��a. There is evidence of this in Paur�amas'i's address to one crying

associate of Radhara�'i: "My dear daughter, don't be worried because

Sr'imat'i Radhara�'i is belching. I am about to offer a remedial measure

for this symptom. Do not cry so loudly. This belching is not due to
indigestion; it is a sign of ecstatic love for Kr��a. I shall arrange to
cure this belching symptom immediately. Don't be worried." This
statement of Paur�amas'i is evidence that ecstatic love for Krwa is
sometimes manifested through belching.
Sometimes trembling of the whole body and hemorrhaging from

some part of the body are also manifested in response to ecstatic

love for Kr�I;ta, but such symptoms are very rare, and therefore Srila
Riipa Gosvami does not discuss any further on this point.

28 I Other Ecstatic Symptoms

Existential Ecstatic Love for Krf!W
When a devotee is always intensely affected by love for Kr��a in a
direct relationship with Him-or even a little apart from Him-his
status is called existential ecstatic love. The symptoms originating
from such existential ecstatic love are divided into three headings­
namely, moist, burnt and dried-up.
Moist existential ecstatic love aroused in connection with Kr��a is
divided into two: direct and indirect. Radhara�'i was weaving a gar­
land of kunda flowers, and, upon hearing the vibration of Kr��a's
flute, She immediately stopped Her work. This is an example of
direct moistened existential ecstatic love. Indirect moistened existen­
tial ecstatic love is described in the following statement: Krwa, who
is also called Puru§lottama, is to the eyes of Mother Y asoda just like
the cloud is to the eyes of the ciitaki bird. When Kr9�a had been
brought to Mathura, Mother Y asoda, being very anxious and angry,
began to rebuke the King of Mathura.
Burnt existential ecstatic love is divided into three, and one exam­
ple is as follows: One day, Mother Y asoda was dreaming that the gi­
gantic demon, Putana, was lying on the courtyard of her house, and
she immediately became anxious to seek out Kr��a.
When there are manifestations of ecstatic symptoms in the body
of a nondevotee, these are called dried-up symptoms of ecstatic love.
The nondevotees are actually materialistic, but in contact with some
pure devotee, they sometimes may manifest some symptoms of ec­
stasy. Devotional scholars call these dried-up symptoms.
230

The Nectar of Devotion

231

There are eight symptoms of existential ecstatic love: becoming
stunned, perspiring, standing of the hairs on the body, faltering of
the voice, trembling of the body, changing bodily colors, shedding
tears, and devastation.
The scientific explanation of these eight symptoms is given by
Rupa Gosvami as follows: When the vital force of life is in contact
with the earth, it is called stunning. When the same force comes into
contact with water, there is the shedding of tears. When the same
force comes into contact with fire, there is perspiration. When the
same force comes into contact with the sky, there is complete devas­
tation. And when that force comes into contact with the air, there is
trembling, failing of the voice and standing of the hairs on the body.
These symptoms are sometimes manifested internally and some­
times externally. The pure devotee always feels such symptomatic
expressions within himself, but being afraid. of outsiders he does not
generally manifest them externally.

Becoming Stunned
The symptom of becoming stunned is caused by ecstatic tribula­
tion, fearfulness, astonishment, lamentation and anger. This symp­
tom is exhibited by a stoppage of talking, a stoppage of movement, a
feeling of voidness and an extreme feeling of separation.
When Uddhava was describing Kr�!la's pastimes to Vidura, he said,
"One day the gopis became stunned when Kr�!la, in the dress of a
gardening maid, entered the greenhouse and enlivened them with

j oking and laughter. Then when Kr�!la left the greenhouse, the gopis
were seeing Kr�!la so ecstatically that it was as though both their
minds and eyes were following Him." These symptoms signify that
although the

gopis' business was not finished, they had become

stunned with ecstatic love.
Another example of being stunned took place when Krwa was
surrounded by various wrestlers in the sacrificial arena of Kamsa. His
mother, Devaki, * then became stunned, and her eyes dried up when
she saw Kr�!la amongst the wrestlers.
*

/

Devaki was the "natural" mother of Kr�l)a, His father being Vasudeva. In order

to protect the divine baby from Devaki's brother Kamsa, Vasudeva delivered
Kr�l)a to Nanda and Mother Y asoda in Vrndavana, and it was there that He

There is also an example of the astonishment of Lord Brahma. It is

explained in the Tenth Canto, 13th Chapter, 51st verse of Srimad­

Bhiigavatam that when Brahma understood that this cowherd boy
was the Supreme Personality of Godhead Himself, he became stunned.
All of his sensual activities became stopped upon seeing all the
cowherd boys again, along with Kr��a. Lord Brahma was so stunned
that he appeared to be a golden statue with four heads. Also, when
the residents of Braja found that Kr��a had lifted Govardhan Hill
with His left hand, they became stunned.
Astonishment caused by lamentation is exemplified when Kr��a
was entering into the belly of the Bakasura demon and all the demi­
gods from higher planets became stunned with lamentation. A similar
example of becoming stunned was visible in Arjuna when he saw that
Asvatthama was attempting to release his brahmiistrat at Kr��a.

Perspiration
An example of perspiring because of jubilation is described in

Srimad-Bhiigavatam. One gopi addressed Radhara�l thusly: "My dear
Radhara�l, You are rebuking the sunshine unnecessarily, but I can

understand that You are perspiring only because of Your becoming
too lusty at seeing Kr��a."
Perspiration caused by fearfulness was exhibited by Raktak, one
of the servants of Krwa. One day Kr��a dressed Himself just like
Abhimanyu, the husband of Radhara�i Abhimanyu did not like
Radharanl's association with Krsna, and therefore when Raktak saw
.

.

.

.

Kr��a in the dress of Abhimanyu and thus mistook His identity, he
began to strongly rebuke Him. As soon as Raktak finally understood
that it was Kr��a in the dress of Abhimanyu, he began perspiring.
This perspiration was caused by fearfulness.
Perspiration due to anger was exhibited by Garu�a, the eagle who
is the carrier of Vi��u. Once the heavenly king, Indra, was sending

exhibited His childhood pastimes. At sixteen years of age He returned to Mathurii.
(where Devaki had given birth to Him) and vanquished Kamsa in the arena men­

tioned here. See the author's K[§FJ-a, as well as his Sr!mad-Bhagavatam, for fuller
details of these events.

torrents of rain over Vrndiivana. Garu�a was observing the incident

from above the clouds, and because of his anger, he began perspiring.
Standing of Hairs on the Body

The standing up of hair on the body was manifested when Mother

Yasoda found within Kr��a 's mouth all of the universal planetary

systems. She had asked Kr��a to open His mouth wide just to see
whether He had eaten dirt. But when Kr�r;ta opened His mouth, she

saw not only the entire earth, but also many other planets within
His mouth. This caused a standing up of the hair on her body.

The standing up of hair on the body resulting from jubilation is

described in the Tenth Canto, 30th Chapter, 9th verse of Srimad­

Bhiigavatam in connection with the gopis engaged in the riisa dance.

During this riisa dance Kr��a disappeared all of a sudden with

Radhariir;t'i, and the gopis began to search Him out. At that time they

addressed the earth and began to say, "My dear earthly planet; how
many austerities and penances you must have undergone to have the

lotus feet of Krwa always touching your surface. I think that you

must be very jubilant because the trees and ·plants; which are just
like hairs on your body, are standing up so gloriously. May we ask

when did you first get these symptoms? Are you enjoying this jubi­
lation since you were touched by the incarnation of Vamana or since

you were delivered by the incarnation of Varaha?"

Kr��a would sometimes perform mock fighting along with the

cowherd boys. When Kr��a blew His horn in this mock fighting,

Sr'idamii, who was on the opposing side, felt his bodily·hairs stand

up. Similarly, when Arjuna saw Kr��a in His gigantic universal form,

there was a standing of the hairs on his body.
Faltering of the Voice

When Krwa was going to Mathura on the chariot driven by Akriira,

Yasoda and all the gopis came to try to forbid Him to pass and to

block His way. At that time Radhara�'i was so perturbed that in a
faltering voice, She requested Mother Yasoda to please stop Akriira.

Faltering of the voice resulting from wonder was exhibited by

234

Other Ecstatic Symptoms

Brahma. It is said in Srimad-Bhiigavatam, Tenth Canto, 13th Chapter,

59th verse that, after bowing down before Lord Kn;!la, when Brahma

began to rise he prayed to the Lord in a faltering voice.

In the Tenth Canto, 29th Chapter, 27th verse, another example of

faltering of the voice was exhibited by the gopis when they came to

Kr9�a, desiring to dance with Him. Kr9!1a asked them to go back to

their husbands and homes. The gopis apparently became very angry

and began to talk to Kr9�a with faltering voices.
In

the

Tenth

Canto,

39th

Chapter,

48th

verse,

of Srimad­

Bhiigavatam a faltering voice due to jubilation was exhibited by
Akrura when he was shown all of the V aiku�tha planets resting with­

in the River Yamuna. When Akrura understood that Krwa was the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, he bowed his head to Kr9!1a's

lotus feet and with folded hands began to pray in a faltering voice.
There are also examples of faltering of the voice caused by fearful­

ness.

One of Kr9�a's friends praised Him thusly: "My dear friend, Your

flute was given to Your servant, Patr'i, and when I asked him to re­
turn it he began speaking in a faltering voice, and his complexion be­
came yellow."

Trembling
When Kr9�a was trying to capture the demon Sankha, Radharii!l'i

began trembling out of fearfulness. Similar trembling of the body was
exhibited in Sahadeva, the younger brother of Nakula. When Sisupala

was vehemently blaspheming the Lord, Sahadeva began to tremble
out of anger.

Trembling of the body was also exhibited by Radharii!l'i out of

tribulation. Radharii!l'i trembled as She told one of the gopis: "Don't

joke with this disappointing boy! Please ask Him not to approach
Me, because He is always the cause of all grief for us."

Changing of Bodily Color
Sometimes, due to great aggrievement caused by the dealings of

235

The Nectar of Devotion

Krwa, the body changes color. The gopis therefore addressed the
Lord thusly: "My dear Kr�pa, due to separation from You, all of the

denizens of Vrndavana have changed their color. And because of this
change of color even the great sage Narada was thinking of Vrn­

davana as a white island in the ocean of milk."

When Kr�pa and Balarama were present in the arena of Kamsa,

Kamsa's body changed color. Similarly, Indra's face changed color

when he saw that Kr�pa was protecting all the denizens of Braja by
lifting Govardhan Hill. If the color change takes place due to ex­

cessive jubilation, the hue turns red. Because such change of color is
so rare, Srila Riipa Gosvami does not further discuss this point.

Tears
Out of jubilation, anger, or separation there may be the pouring
down of tears from the eyes. When such tears are very cold they are

due to jubilation, and when they are due to anger the tears become
hot. In all cases there is a severe movement of the eyes, an<!__the eyes
generally become reddish. There is also an itching sensation which

causes the sufferer to rub his eyes.

When the lotus-eyed Rukmipi, the first queen of Kr�pa in Dvaraka,

was shedding tears out of ecstatic jubilation, she did not like the

tears. There is a passage in the Hari-vam§a wherein Satyabhama begins
to shed tears because of her great affection for Kr�pa.
An example of shedding tears because of anger was exhibited by
Bhima when he saw that Sisupala was insulting Kr�pa in the riija-suya

arena of sacrifice. Bhima wanted to kill Sisupala immediately, but

because Kr�pa did not order him to do so, he became morose with
anger. It is described that there were hot tears covering his eyes, as a
thin cloud sometimes covers the evening moon. In the evening, when
the moon is slightly covered by a thin cloud, it looks very nice, and
when Bhima was shedding tears on account of his anger, he also look­
ed very nice.

In the Tenth Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, Chapter 68, verse 23,

there is a nice example of Rukmipi shedding tears of lamentation.

When Kr�pa and Rukmipi were talking, Rukmipi became frightened

of separation from Kr�pa, and therefore she began scratching the

Other Ecstatic Symptoms

236

earth with her red, lotus-like nails. Because she was shedding tears,
the black ointment from her eyes was dripping, along with the tears,

onto her breasts, which were covered with kunkum powder. Rukmi�ii
was so aggrieved that her voice was choked up.
Devastation
When a person is confused by simultaneous happiness and tribula­
tion and does not know what to do, this state of confusion is called
pralaya, or devastation. In this condition of pralaya one sometimes
falls down on the ground, and all the symptoms of ecstatic love be­
come manifest. When the gopis were searching after Kr�l!a and all of a
sudden He came out from the bushes and creepers, all of them be­

came stunned and almost senseless. In this state the gopis appeared
very beautiful. This is an example of pralaya, or devastation in happi­

ness.

There are also instances of pralaya in distress. One such example is

described in the Tenth Canto, 39th Chapter, 14th verse of Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, where Sukadeva Gosvami tells King Parik�it: "My dear
King, when the gopis were missing Kr�l)a, they were so much ab­

sorbed in meditation upon Him that all of their senses stopped func­
tioning, and they lost all bodily sense. It was as though they had be­
come liberated from all material conditions."
Out of the many ecstatic symptoms of the body, the symptom of
being stunned is especially significant. According to the degree of
bei-ng stunned, the vital force within the body becomes agitated, and
due to such a state, the other ecstatic loving symptoms sometimes
become altered. These transcendental ecstatic symptoms gradually
develop, and in the course of such development, they are sometimes

called smoky, sometimes called blazing, and sometimes called shining.

These three degrees are experienced for many, many years and
extend to different parts of the body. Unlike the shedding of tears
and faltering of the voice, the condition of being stunned is spread
all over the body. The shedding of tears and faltering of the voice are
simply localized symptoms.
The shedding of tears, however, sometimes makes the eyes become

237

The Nectar of Devotion

swollen and whitish, and sometimes the lenses of the eyes become
differently focused. Faltering of the voice may sometimes cause
choking in the throat and extreme anxiety. As the different symp­
toms of these ecstatic manifestations are localized, they are accom­
panied by different local reactions; e.g., when the throat is choked up
because of a faltering voice, there may be a sound like "ghra." Such
sounds choke up the voice, and with extreme mental anxiety they
may manifest in different ways. All these symptoms are listed under
the dried-up existential condition known as smoky, and they are
exhibited in different ways.
Sometimes, while participating in ceremonies celebrating Krwa's
pastimes, or in the society of devotees, there is dancing ecstasy. Such
sentiments are called blazing.
None of the above symptoms can be manifested without the basic
principle of strong attachment for Kr��a. In the smoky condition of
such ecstatic expressions, the symptoms could otherwise be hidden.
This type of symptom was experienced by Priest Gargamuni, who
was performing some ritualistic ceremony in the house of Nanda
Maharaj. When he heard about Kr��a's killing of the Aghasura demon,
there were some tears visible in his eyes, his throat was trembling, and
perspiration covered his whole body. In this way Priest Gargamuni's
beautiful face assumed a nice condition.
When several such ecstatic symptoms are visible, the condition is
called blazing. For example, some of Kr��a's friends told Him, "My
dear friend, as soon as I heard the sound of Your flute from within
the forest, my hands became almost motionless and my eyes became
full of tears. So much so, in fact, that I could not recognize Your
peacock feather. My thighs became almost completely stunned so
that I could not move even an inch. Therefore, my dear friend, I
must acknowledge the wonderful vibration of Your transcendental
flute."
Similarly, one gopi said to another, "My dear friend, when I heard
the sound of Kr�9a's flute, I tried to hide myself from the reaction of
the vibrations. But still I could not check the trembling of my body,
and therefore all of my friends in the house could detect my attach­
ment for Kr��a without any doubt."

Other Ecstatic Symptoms

238

When the ecstatic symptoms cannot be checked, and they simul­

taneously appear in four or five different categories, this stage of
ecstatic love is called shining. The example is cited, in this connec­

tion, that when the sage Narada saw Lord Krg1a standing before him,
his body became so stunned that he stopped playing on his vir-a.

Because of his faltering voice he could not offer any prayers to Kr9pa,

and his eyes became filled with tears. Thus, Narada's ability to see
Krsna was also obstructed
.
.
When similar symptoms were manifest in the body of Sr'imat'i

Radharap'i, some of Her friends criticized Her: "My dear friend, You

are blaming the flavor of the flowers for the tears in Your eyes. You

are rebuking the air for the standing of the hairs on Your body. And

You are cursing Your walking in the forest for Your thighs being

stunned. But Your faltering voice reveals the cause to be different: it
is just Your attachment for Kr9pa!"

Sn,a Riipa Gosvam'i remarks that when various symptoms become

manifest very prominently, the devotee's condition can be called the

brightest. For example, a friend of Kr9pa addressed Him as follows:

"My dear Pitambara, because of separation from You all the residents

of Goloka Vrndavana are perspiring. They are lamenting with differ­
ent words, and their eyes have become moistened with tears. Actual­
ly, all of them are in great confusion."

There is a supreme symptom of ecstatic love which is called mahii­

bhiiva. This mahiibhiiva expression was possible only in Radharap'i,

but later on when Sri Kr9pa Caitanya appeared to feel the mode of

love of Radharap'i, He also expressed all of the symptoms of mahii­

bhiiva. Sri Riipa Gosvam'i says in this connection that when the symp­

toms of ecstatic love become the most bright, that stage is accepted

as mahiibhiiva.

Srila Riipa Gosvam'i further analyzes the ecstatic loving expression

into four divisions which are called sattviibhiisa.

Sometimes impersonalists who are not actually in devotional ser­

vice may also exhibit such symptoms of ecstatic love, but this is not
accepted as actual ecstasy. It is a reflection only. For example, some­

times in Varapas'i, a holy city for impersonalist scholars, there may
be seen a sannyiisi crying from hearing the glories of the Lord. Im-

239

The Nectar of Devotion

personalists also sometimes chant the Hare Kr��a mantra and dance,
but their aim is not to serve the Lord. It is to become one with the
Lord and merge into His existence. Riipa Gosvami therefore says that
even if the reactions to chanting are manifested in the impersonalist's
body, they should not be considered to be symptoms of actual at­
tachment, but reflections only, just like the sun reflected in a dark
room through some polished glass. The chanting of Hare Kr��a, how­
ever, is so nice and transcendental that it will eventually melt even
the hearts of persons who are impersonalists. Riipa Gosvami says
that the impersonalists' symptoms are simply reflections of ecstatic
love, not the real thing.
Sometimes it is found that when staunch logicians, without any
trace of devotional service and without actually understanding the
transcendental glories of the Lord, sit down to hear the glories of the
Lord, they appear to be melting and shedding tears. In this connec­
tion there is a statement by a devotee who is addressing the Lord
thusly: "My dear Mukunda, I cannot properly express the glories of
Your pastimes. Even when the nondevotees hear of Your glorious
pastimes they become affected and shed tears and start to tremble."
Such nondevotees are not actually melted; they are hard-hearted. But
the influence of the glories of the Lord is so great that even the non­
devotees sometimes shed tears.
Sometimes it is found that a nondevotee 'who has practically no
taste for Krwa and who follows no rules or regulations can, by prac­
tice, make a show of devotional symptoms, even crying in an assem­
bly of devotees. This shedding of tears is not actually an ecstatic
loving expression, however. It is done simply by practice. Although
there is no need to describe these reflections of ecstatic love, Riipa
Gosvami gives some instances where there is no actual devotional
service and such expressions are manifested.

29 I Expressions of Love for Kr��a

There are some bodily symptoms which express overwhelming ec­
static love. They are counted at thirty-one as follows: disappoint­
ment, lamentation, humility, guilt, fatigue, intoxication, pride, doubt,
apprehension, intense emotion, madness, forgetfulness, disease, con­
fusion, death, laziness, inertness, bashfulness, concealment, remem­
bering, argumentativeness, anxiety, thoughtfulness, endurance, happi­
ness, eagerness, haughtiness, envy, impudence, dizziness and alertness.
Disappointment

When one is forced to act in a way which is forbidden, or to refrain
from acting in a way which is proper, he becomes regretful and thinks
himself dishonored. At that time there is a sense of disappointment.
In this kind of disappointment one becomes full of anxiety, sheds
tears, changes bodily color, feels humility and breathes heavily.
When Krgta, in punishing the Kaliya serpent, appeared to have
drowned Himself in the poisonous water of the Yam una, N anda
Maharaj addressed Yasoda Devi thusly: "My dear wife, Kn>pa has
gone deep into the water, and so there is no longer any need to main­
tain our bodies, which are so full of sinful activities! Let us also enter
into the poisonous water of the Yam una and compensate for the
sinful activities of our lives!" This is an instance of severe shock,
where the devotee becomes greatly disappointed.
When Krsna left Vrndavana, Subala, His intimate friend, decided to
.

.

.

.

'

leave also. While leaving, Subala was contemplating that without
Kr�pa there was no longer any pleasure to be found in V rndavana.
240

241

The Nectar of Devotion

The analogy is given that, as the bees go away from a flower that has

no honey, so Subala left V rndavana when he found there was no

longer any relishable transcendental pleasure there.

In Diina-keli-kaumudi Srimati Radhara!li addresses one of Her

friends in this manner: "My dear friend, if I cannot hear of the glori- .
ous activities of Kr�!ia, it is better for Me to become deaf. And be­

cause I am now unable to see Him, it would be good for Me to be a

blind woman." This is another instance of disappointment due to
separation from Kr�!ia.

There is a statement in the Hari-varhsa wherein Satyabhama, one

of the queens of Kr�!la in Dvaraka, tells her husband: "My dear
Kr�!la, since I heard Narada glorifying Rukmi!li before You, I can

understand that there is no need of any talking about myself." This

is an instance of disappointment caused by envy. Rukmi!li and Satya­

bhama were co-wives, and because Kr�!la was husband of both, there

naturally was some feminine envy between them. So when Satya­

bhama heard the glories of Rukmi!li, she was envious of her and thus

became disappointed.

In the Tenth Canto, 51st Chapter, 29th verse of Srimad-Bhiigavatam

there is this statement: "My dear Kr�!ia, I cannot say that it is only
other people who are implicated in material existence, because I too

am much entangled with the bodily concept of life. I am always
too anxious about my family, home, wife, wealth, land and kingdom.

And because I have been so maddened by this material atmosphere, I

am thinking now that my life has been simply spoiled." This state­

ment is an instance of disappointment caused by lamentation.

According to Bharata Muni, this disappointment is inauspicious.
But there are other learned scholars who have accepted such disap­
pointment as being in the mood of neutrality and as being a preserva­
tive for ecstatic love.
Lamentation

When one is unsuccessful in achieving his desired goal of life, when
one finds no fulfillment in his present occupation, when one finds

himself in reversed conditions and when one feels guilt-at such time
one is said to be in a state of lamentation.

Expressions of Love for K[§[ta

242

In this condition of lamentation one becomes questioning, thought­
ful, tearful, regretful and heavy-breathed. His bodily color changes,
and his mouth becomes dry.
One aged devotee of Krwa addressed Him in this way: "My ,dear
Kr�!ia, 0 killer of the demon Agha, my body is now invalid due to
old age. I cannot speak very fluently, my voice is faltering, my mind
is not strong, and I am often attacked with forgetfulness. But, my
dear Lord, You are just like the moonlight, and my only real regret
is that for want of any taste for Your pleasant shining I did not ad­
vance myself in Kr�!la consciousness." This statement is an instance
of lamentation due to one's being unable to achieve his desired goal.
One devotee said, "This night I was dreaming of collecting various
flowers from the garden, and I was thinking of making a garland to
offer to Kr�!ia. But I am so unfortunate that all of a sudden my
dream was o'ver, and I could not achieve my desired goal!" This
statement is an instance of lamentation resulting from nonfulfillment
of one's duties.
When N anda Maharaj saw his foster son, Kr�!ia, embarrassed in the
sacrificial arena of Kamsa, he said, "How unfortunate I am that I did
not keep my son bolted within a room. Unfortunately, I have
brought Him to Mathura, and now I see that He's embarrassed by
this giant elephant named Kuvalaya. It is as though the moon of
Krwa is eclipsed by the shadow of the eartq." This is an instance of
lamentation caused by reversed conditions.

In the Tenth Canto, 14th Chapter, 9th verse of Srimad-Bhiigavatam
there is a statement by Brahma: "My dear Lord, just see my im­
pudence! You are unlimited, the original Personality of Godhead, the
supersoul-and You rule over the most perfect illusory energies! And
just see my impudence! I wanted to supersede You by my own per­
sonal power, and I was very puffed up with this tiny power of mine.
Just as a simple spark from a fire cannot do any harm to the fire, so
my bewildering potency was completely unsuccessful in thwarting
Your superior illusory power. Therefore I find myself to be most
insignificant

and think of myself as a most useless person." This

statement by Brahma is an instance of lamentation caused by com­
mitting an offense.

243

Humility
A sense of weakness caused by distress, fearfulness or offensiveness
is called humility. ln this condition one becomes talkative, small in
heart, dirty in mind, full of anxiety and inactive.
In

verse

of Srimad­

Bhiigavatam there is the following statement by King Mucukunda:

"My dear Lord, because of my bad deeds in the past I am everlast­
ingly aggrieved. I am always suffering from my -desires, but still my
senses are never satisfied with material enj oyments. Somehow or
other I am, by Your grace, now in a peaceful condition because I
have taken shelter of Your lotus feet, which are always free from all
lamentation, fear- and death. 0 supreme protector, 0 supreme soul!

0 supreme controller! Kindly gi ve me Your protection. I am so much
embarrassed." This statement by Mucukunda is an instance of humili­
ty resulting from a severely miserable condition of material existence.
When Uttara was attacked by the brahmiistra of Asvatthama, she
became afraid of losing her child, Maharaj Parik�it, who was still with­
in the womb. She immediately surrendered to Krwa and said, "My
dear Lord, kindly save my child! I do not mind if I myself must be
killed by the brahmiistra of Asvatthama." This is an instance of
humility caused by fear.
In

the

Tenth

Chapter,

lOth verse

of Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, Lord Brahma says, "0 infallible one! I am born in the
modes of passion, and therefore I have been falsely proud of being
the creator of this material world. My false pride was j ust like dense
darkness, and in this darkness I had become blind. In my blindness I
was considering myself a competitor to You, the Supreme Personality
of Godhead. But, my dear Lord, even though I am accepted as the
creator of this universe, I am eternally Your servant. Therefore, kind­
ly always be compassionate toward me and excuse me in tnat way."
This statement by Brahma is another instance of humility resulting
from committing an offense.
Sometimes there is humility due to shyness. For example, when

Kr��a stole all of the garments from the gopis while they were bath­

ing in the river, all of them begged Kr��a not to commit this in-

Expressions of Love for Krr!w

244

justice upon them. The gopis addressed Him thus: "My dear Kr9!J.a,

we know that You are the son of Nanda Maharaj and that You are

the most beloved of all V rndavana. And You are very much loved by
us also! But why are You giving us this trouble? Kindly return our
garments. Just see how we are trembling from the severe cold!" This

humility was due to their shyness from being naked before Kr9!J.a.
Guilt

When a person blames himself for committing an inappropriate

action, his feeling is called guilt.

One day Sr'imat'i Radharii!J.'i was churning curd for Kr9!J.a. At that

time the jeweled bangles on Her hands were circling around, and She

was also chanting the holy name of Kr9!J.a. All of a sudden She

thought, "I am chanting the holy name of Kr�!J.a, and My superiors­

My mother-in-law and My sister-in-law-may hear Me!" By this
thought Radharii!J.'i became overanxious. This is an instance of feel­

ing guilty because of devotion to Kr9!J.a.

One day the beautiful-eyed Sr'imat'i Radharii!J.'i entered into the

forest to collect some flowers to prepare a garland for Kr9!J.a. While
collecting the flowers, She became afraid that someone might see
Her, and She felt some fatigue and weakness. This is an instance of

guilty feelings caused by labor for Kr�!J.a.

There is a statement in Rasa-sudhiikara that after passing the night

with Kr�!J.a, Radharii!J.'i became so weak that She was unable to get up

from bed. When Kr9pa took Her hand to help Her, Radharii!J.'i felt
guilty about having passed the night with Him.
Fatigue

Fatigue is felt after walking a long distance, after dancing and

after sex activity. In this kind of fatigue there is dizziness, perspira­

tion, inactivity of the limbs, yawning and very heavy breathing.

One day Yasoda was chasing Krwa in the yard after He had offend­

ed Her. After a while Yasoda became very fatigued, and therefore she

was perspiring, and her bunched hair became loosened. This is an

The Nectar of Devotion

245

instance of becoming fatigued because of working too much.
Sometimes all

of

the

cowherd friends of Kr�tla, along with

Balarama, danced together in some ceremony. At these times the
garlands on Their necks would move, and They would begin to per·
spire. Their whole bodies became wet from Their ecstatic dancing.
This is an instance of fatigue caused by dancing.

.

In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, Tenth Canto, 33rd Chapter, 20th verse

it is said that after enj oying love affairs with Kr�tla by dancing, em·

bracing and kissing, the gopis would sometimes become very tired,
and Kr�tla, out of His causeless mercy and compassion, would smear
their faces with His lotus hands. This is an example of fatigue caused
by laboring in the rasa dance.

Intoxication
When one becomes arrogant with false prestige due to drinking
intoxicants or being too lustful, the voice becomes faulty, the eyes
become swollen, and there are symptoms of redness on the body.
There is a statement in the Lalita-madhava that Lord Baladeva, in­

toxicated from drinking excessive quantities of honey, once began to
address the ants: "0 you kings of the ants! Why are you hiding your­
selves in these holes?" At the same time He also addressed the King
of heaven: "0 King Indra! You plaything of

S aci! Why are you

laughing? I am now prepared to smash the whole universe, and I
know that Kr�tla will not be angry with Me."* Then He addressed
Kr�tla: "My dear Kr�tla, tell Me immediately why the whole world is
trembling, and why the moon has become elongated! And 0 you
members of the Yadu dynasty, why are you laughing at Me? Please

gi ve me back My liquors made of honey from the kadamba flower!"
S rila Rupa Gosvami prays that Lord Balarama will be pleased with all
of us while He is thus talking j ust like an intoxicated person.
In this state of intoxication, Balarama felt tired and lay down for

Baladeva, or Balarama, is the older brother of Kr�J)a, an expansion of the
Godhead Himself, and therefore to be considered an incarnation of God, as is
explained in the Sr"imad-Bhiigavatam.

Expressions of Love for Knrw

246

rest. Generally, those who are exalted personalities lie down when

they feel intoxicated, whereas those who are mediocre laugh and sing
during intoxication, and those who are lowly use vulgar language and

sometimes cry. Such intoxication is manifested according to different

ages and mentalities. Srila Riipa Gosvam'i does not describe further in
this direction because there is no necessity for such a discussion.

There is another description of the symptoms of intoxication in

the person of Sr'i Radhara�'i after She saw Kr��a: sometimes She was

walking hither and thither, sometimes She was laughing, sometimes
She was covering Her face, sometimes She was talking without any

meaning, and sometimes She was praying to Her associate gopis. See­

ing these symptoms in Radhara�'i, the gopis began to talk among

themselves: "Just see how Radhara�'i has become intoxicated simply
by seeing Kr��a before Her!" This is an instance of ecstatic love in
intoxication.
Pride
Expressions of ecstatic love in pride may be the result of excessive

wealth, exquisite beauty, first-class residence, or the attainment of
one's ideal goal. One is also considered to be proud when he does not
care about the neglect of others.

Bilvamangala Thakur said, "My dear Krwa, You are leaving me,

forcibly getting out of my clutches. But I shall be impressed by Your

strength only when You can go forcibly from the core of my heart."
This is an instance of feeling pride in ecstatic love for Kr��a.

Once during the riisa dance, when Radhara�'i left the arena, and

Krsna went to seek Her out, one of the dear friends of Radharan'i
. .

.

.

began to address Kr��a thusly: "My dear Kr��a, You have been very
much obliging in serving the form of our Sr'i Radhara�'i, and now You

have left all the other gopis to search for Her. Please allow me to

inquire how You want Her to treat You." This is an instance of

feeling pride on account of exquisite beauty.
Sometimes Radhara�'i felt pride within Herself and said, "Al­

though the cowherd boys prepare nice flower garlands for Kr��a,

when

I

present My

garland

to

Him, He becomes struck with

247

The Nectar of Devotion

wonder and immediately accepts it and puts it on His heart."

Similarly, in the Tenth Canto, 2nd Chapter, 27th verse of Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, Lord Brahma says: "My dear Madhusiidana, persons
who are pure devotees of Your Lordship actually feel Your ecstatic
friendship, and as such they are never vanquished by enemies. They
know they are always protected by You, and so they can matter-of­
factly pass over the heads of their enemies without any care." In
other words, one who has taken complete shelter under the lotus feet
of the Lord is always proud of being able to conquer all enemies.
One weaver at Mathura addressed Krg•a in this way: "My dear
King of Vrndavana, I have become so proud of Your causeless mercy
upon me that I do not even count upon the mercy of the lord of
Vaiku!J.tha, which is sought after by many great sages in deep medita­

tion." In other words, although the yogis and great sages sit in medi­
tation upon Lord Vi�!J.U, who is residing in Vaiku!J.tha, a devotee of
Kr�!la is so proud that he does not consider such meditation to be
very valuable. This feeling of pride is due to one's having achieve.d the
highest goal of life- Kr�!J.a.
Doubt
After Lord Brahma had stolen all of the calves, cows and cowherd
boys from Kr�!J.a, he was trying to go away. But all of a sudden he
became doubtful about his stealing affairs and began to watch on all
sides with his eight eyes. Lord Brahma has four heads, and therefore
he has eight eyes. This is an instance of ecstatic love in doubtfulness,
caused by stealing.

Similarly, just to please Kr�!la, Akriira stole the Syamantaka-mar-i,

a stone which can produce unlimited quantities of gold, but later on
he repented his stealing. This is another instance of ecstatic love for
Kr�!la in doubt caused by stealing.
The King of heaven, Indra, was advised to surrender himself at the
lotus feet of Kr�!la when he was causing torrents of rain to fall on the
land of Braja. At that time lndra's face became very darkened out of
doubtfulness.

Apprehension

When a person becomes disturbed in his heart by seeing lightning
in the sky, by seeing a ferocious animal, or by hearing a tumultuous
sound, his state of mind is called apprehensive. In such a state of
apprehension, one tries to take shelter of something which provides
safety. There may be standing of the hairs on the body, trembling of
the body and sometimes the committing of mistakes. And sometimes
the body may become stunned.
In the Padyavali there is the following statement: "My dear friend,
Kr9�a 's residence in the demonic circle at Mathura, under the suprema­
cy of the King of demons, Kamsa, is causing me much worry." This
is one instance of apprehending some danger to Kr9�a in ecstatic love
for Him.
When Vr9asura appeared in Vrndavana as a bull, all of the gopis
became greatly affected with fear. Being perturbed in that way, they
.began to embrace the tamala trees. This is an instance of fearfulness
caused. by a ferocious animal and of the search for shelter while
remembering Krwa in ecstatic love. Upon hearing the jackals crying
in the forest of Vrndiivana, Mother Yasoda sometimes became very
careful about keeping Kr9�a under her vigilance, fearing that Kr9�a
might be attacked by them. This is an instance of ecstatic love for
Kr9�a in fearfulness caused by a tumultuous sound. This kind of fear­
fulness is a little different from being actually afraid. When one is
afraid of something, he can still think of past and future. But when
there is this kind of ecstatic apprehension, there is no scope for such
thinking.
Intense Emotion

Emotion is caused by something very dear, by something very
detestable, by fire, strong wind, strong rainfall, by some natwal dis­
turbance, the sight of a big elephant, or the sight of an enemy. When
there is emotion caused by seeing something very dear, one can speak
very swiftly and use kind words. When there is emotion caused by

249

The Nectar of Devotion

seeing something detestable, one cries very loudly. When there is
emotion caused by seeing fire, one tries to fly away. There may also
be trembling of the body, closing of the eyes and tears in the eyes.
When one becomes emotional on account of a strong wind, one tries
to run very swiftly and rubs his eyes. When one is emotional because
of rainfall, one takes an umbrella, and there is tension in his body.
When there is emotion due to a sudden disturbance, one's face
becomes discolored, one becomes struck with wonder, and there is
trembling of the body. If there is emotion from seeing an elephant,

one may j ump, show various signs of fearfulness, and sometimes one

may keep looking behind him. When there is emotion due to the
presence of an enemy, one looks for a fatal weapon and· tries to
escape.
When Kn;�a returned from the forest of V rndavana, Mother Yasoda
was so emotional from seeing her son that milk began to flow from
her breasts. This is an instance of emotion caused by seeing a dear ob­

j ect.

In the Tenth Canto, 23rd Chapter, 13th verse of Srimad­
Bhiigavatam, S ukadeva Gosvami informs King Parik�it: "My dear
King, the wives of the briihmar;ws were usually very much attached to
the glorification of Kn;�a, and they were always anxious to get an
opportunity to see Him. Because of this, when they heard that Kn;�a
was nearby, they became very anxious to see Him and immediately
left their homes." This is an instance of emotional activity caused by
the presence of someone who is very dear.
When Putana, the demoniac witch, was struck down and killed by
Kr��a, Mother Yasoda was struck with wonder and began to cry emo­
tionally, "Oh, what is this? What is this?" When she saw that her dear
baby Kr��a was playing on the chest of the dead demonic woman,
Mother Yasoda, at a loss what to do, began to walk this way and that.
This is an instance of being emotional on account of seeing some­
thing ghastly.

When Krwa uprooted the two arjuna trees and Yasoda heard the

sound of the trees crashing down, she became overcome with emo­
tion and simply stared upwards, being too bewildered to know what
else to do. This is an instance of being emotional from hearing a
tumultuous sound.

250

Expressions of Love for Kr§fW

When there was a forest fire in Vrndavana, all the cowherd men as­
sembled together and desperately appealed to Kr��a for protection.
This is an instance of emotion caused by fire.
The whirlwind demon known as Tr�avarta once carried Krwa off
from the ground and blew Him around, along with some very big
trees. At that time, Mother Yasoda could not see her son, and she
was so disturbed that she began to walk this way and that. This is an
instance of emotion caused by severe wind.
In

the

Tenth

Canto,

25th

Chapter,

llth

verse

of Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, there is a description of Indra's causing severe torrents
of rain· at Vrndavana. All the cows and cowherd boys became so af­
flicted by the wind and cold that they all gathered together to take
shelter under the lotus feet of Kr��a. This is an instance of emotion
caused by severe rainfall.
There were severe torrents of hail when Kr��a was staying in the
forest of Vrndavana, and the elderly persons bade Him: "Kr��a,
don't You move now! Even persons who are stronger and older than
You cannot move, and You are just a little boy. So please stay still!"
This is an instance of emotion caused by heavy hailing.
When Kr��a .was chastising Kaliya in the poisonous water of the
Yamuna, Mother Yasoda began to speak emotionally: "Oh, see how
the earth appears to be trembling! There appears to be an earth trem­
or, and in the sky tears are flying here and there! My dear son has
entered into the poisonous water of the Yamuna. What shall I do
now?" This is an instance of emotion resulting from a natural dis­
turbance.
In the arena of Kamsa, when Krwa was attacked by big elephants,
all of the ladies present began to address Him in this way: "My dear
boy-please leave this place immediately! Please leave this place im­
mediately! Don't You see the big elephants coming to attack You?
Your innocent gazing upon them is causing us too much perturba­
tion!" Kr��a then told Mother Yasoda, "My dear Mother, don't be
perturbed by the appearance of the elephants and the horses that are
so forcibly coming and raising dust, causing blindness to these lotus­
eyed women. Let even the Kesl demon come before Me; My arms
will still be adequate for victory. So please don't be perturbed."

In the Lalita-miidhava, a friend tells Mother Yasoda: "How won-

251

The Nectar of Devotion

derful it is that when the Sankhacu9a demon-vast and strong as a
great hill-attacked your Cupid-like beautiful son, there was no one
present in Vrndavana to help. And yet the demon was killed by your
little son. It appears to be due to the result of severe penances and
austerities in your past lives that your son was saved in this way."

In the same Lalita-miidhava there is an account of Kr�!la's kidnap­

ping Rukmi!li at her royal marriage ceremony. At that time all of the

princes present began to converse amongst themselves, saying, "We

have our elephants, horses, chariots, bows, arrows and swords, so
why should we be afraid of Kr�!la? Let us attack Him! He is nothing

but a lusty cowherd boy! He cannot take away the Princess in this

way! Let us all attack Him!" This is an instance of emotion caused
by the presence of enemies.

Srila Rupa Gosvami is trying to prove by the above examples that
in relationship with Kr�!la there is no question of impersonalism. All

personal activities are there in relationship with Kr�!la.

Madness
Srila Bilvamangala Thakur prays in his book as follows: "Let Sri­

mat! Radhara!li purify the whole world, because She has surrendered
Herself completely unto Kr�!la. Out of Her ecstatic love for Him,
She sometimes acted j ust like an addled person and attempted to

churn curd, although there was no curd in the pot. And seeing this,

Kr�!la became so enchan�ed by Radhara!li that He began to milk a
bull instead of a cow." These are some of the instances of insanity or
madness in connection with the love affairs of Radha and Krsna. In
the Srimad-Bhiigavatam it is said that when Kr�!la entered the

� � ison­

ous waters of the Yamuna, Srimati Yasoda Devi went insane. Instead

of searching for curative herbs, she began to speak to the trees as if
they were snake chanters. With folded hands she began to bow down
to the trees, asking them, "What is the medicinal herb which can
check Krwa's dying from this poisonous water?" This is an instance
of insanity caused by some great danger.

How a devotee can be in a state of insanity because of ecstatic

love is described in the Tenth Canto, 30th Chapter, 4th verse of

Srimad-Bhiigavatam, where the gopis were searching for Kr�!la in the

Expressions of Love for K[§[W

252

forests of Vrndavana. The gop'is were loudly singing the glories of
Kr�!la and wandering from one forest to another in search of Him.
They knew that Kr�!ia is not localized, but all-pervading. He is in the
sky, He is in the water, He is in the air, He is the supersoul in every­
one's heart. Thus the gopis began to inquire from all kinds of trees
and plants about the Supreme Personality of Godhead. This is an
instance of ecstatic madness on the part of devotees.
Similarly, there are symptoms of diseases caused by ecstatic love.
This condition is credited by learned scholars as mahiibhiiva. This
highly elevated condition is also called divyonmiida, or transcenden­
tal madness.
Forgetfulness

When Kr�!la was absent from V rndavana and was staying in Ma­
thura, Sr'imati Radharii!J.'i sent news to Him that His mother, the
Queen of Braja, was feeling such separation from Him that there was
foam coming from her mouth, like the foam on the shore of the
ocean. And sometimes she was raising her arms like the waves of the
ocean, and because of her intense feelings of separation, she was roll­
ing on the ground and creating a tumultuous roaring sound. And
sometimes she was remaining completely silent, like a calm sea. These
symptoms of separation from Kr�!J.a are called apasmiira, or forgetful­
ness. One completely forgets his position when he manifests these
symptoms in ecstatic love.
Another message was once sent to Kr�!ia informing Him that after
He had killed Kamsa, one of Kamsa 's demon friends had gone insane.
This demon was foaming at the mouth, waving his arms and rolling
on the ground. This demonic demonstration is in relationship with
Kr�!la in ghastly humor. This mellow or flavor is one of the indirect
relationships with Kr�!J.a. The first five kinds of relationships are
called direct, and the other seven are called indirect. Some way or
other, the demon must have had some relationship with Kr�!J.a, be­
cause these symptoms developed when he heard that Kr�!la had al­
ready killed Kamsa. Srila Rupa Gosvam'i remarks that there is also
transcendental excellence in this kind of symptom.

253

The Nectar of Devotion

Disease
When Kr�tta was absent from Vrndavana and was staying at Mathu­

ra, some of His friends informed Him, "My dear Kr�tta, because of

their separation from You, the inhabitants of Braja are so afflicted

that they appear to be diseased. Their bodies are feverish, and they

cannot move properly. They are simply lying down on the ground

and breathing heavily."

In the Tenth Canto, 12th Chapter, 41st verse of Sriinad-Bhiigavatam,

Maharaj Parik�it asked about Lord Ananta, and upon hearing this
question, Sukadeva Gosvami began to show symptoms of collapsing.

Yet he checked himself and answered King Parik�it 's question in a

mild voice. This collapsing condition is described as a feverish state
resulting from ecstatic pleasure.

There is another statement in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam telling of

the damsels of Braja meeting Kr�tta at the sacred place of Kuruk�etra,

many years after their childhood pastimes. When they met in that

sacred place, all the gopis became stunned by the occurrence of a
solar eclipse. Their breathing, blinking of the eyes and all similar ac­

tivities stopped, and they stood before Kr�tta just like statues. This is

another instance of a diseased condition resulting ftom exhuberant
transcendental pleasure.

Confusion
There is the following statement in the Harhsadiita: "One day

when Srimati Radhara�i was feeling much affliction because of Her
separation from Kr�!la, She went to the bank of the Yamuna with

some of Her friends. There Radhara!li saw a cottage wherein She and
Krwa had experienced many loving pleasures, and by remembering

those incidents She immediately became overcome with dizziness.
This dizziness was very prominently visible." This is an instance of
confusion caused by separation.

Similarly, there is a statement describing confusion caused by fear­

fulness. These symptoms were exhibited by A rj una when he saw

Kr�!la's universal form on the battlefield of Kuruk�etra. His confusion

was so strong that his bow and arrows fell from his hand, and he
could not perceive anything clearly.

Death
Once the Bakasura demon assumed the shape of a very big duck

and opened his mouth in order to swallow Kr�!la and all the cowherd

boys. When Kr�!la was entering into the demon's mouth, Balarama
and the other cowherd boys almost fainted and appeared as though
they had no life. Even if they are illusioned by some ghastly scene

or by any accidental occurrence, devotees never forget Krwa. Even

in the greatest danger they can remember Kr��a. This is the benefit
254

The Nectar of Devotion

255

of Kr��a consciousness: even at the time of death, when all the
functions of the body become dislocated, the devotee can remember
Kr��a in his innermost consciousness, and this saves him from falling
down into material existence. In this way Kr��a consciousness im·
mediately takes one from the material platform to the spiritual world.
In this connection there is a statement about persons who died at
Mathura: "These persons had a slight breathing exhiliration, their

eyes were wide open, the colors of their bodies were changed, and

they began to utter the holy name of Kr��a. In this condition they
gave up their material bodies." These symptoms are prior manifesta­
tions of death.

Laziness
When, because of self-satisfaction or dislike of excessive labor, a
person does not perform his duty in spite of having the energy, he is
called lazy. This laziness also is manifest in ecstatic love of Kn;�a. For

example, when some briihmartas were requested by Nanda Maharaj

to circumambulate Govardhan Hill, they told him that they were
more interested in offering benedictions than in circumambulating
Govardhan Hill. This is an instance of laziness caused by self­

satisfaction.

Once when Kr��a, along with His cowherd boy friends, was having

a mock battle, Subala showed the symptoms of fatigue. Kr��a im­

mediately told His other friends: "Subala is feeling too fatigued from
mock-fighting with Me. So please do not disturb him anymore by in­
viting him to fight." This is an instance of laziness caused by dislike
of excessive labor.

Inertness
In the Tenth Canto, 21st Chapter, 13th verse of Srimad-Bhiigavatam

there is an appreciation by the gopis of the inertia of the cows in
Vrndavana. The

gopis saw that the cows were hearing the sweet

songs vibrated by Krwa's flute and were appearing to be drinking the
nectar of these transcendental sounds. The calves were stunned, and
they forgot to drink the milk from the milk bags. Their eyes seemed

Further Features of Ecstatic Love for K[§[W

256

to be embracing Kr�pa, and there were tears in their eyes. This is an
instance of inertia resulting from hearing the transcendental vibra­
tions of Kr�pa's flute.
When Lak�mapa became disturbed upon hearing words against
Kr�pa, she remained inert and did not move her eyelids. This is an­
other example of inertia caused by hearing.

In the Tenth Canto, 7lst Chapter, 35th verse of the Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, there is an account of King Yudhi�thira's bewilderment
after his bringing Kr�pa into his home with the greatest respect. King
Yudhi�thira was very much bewildered because of his transcendental
pleasure at having Kr�pa present in his house. In fact, while receiving
Kr�pa, King Yudhi�thira forgot himself. This is an instance of inertia
resulting from the ecstasy of seeing Krwa.
There is another instance in the Tenth Canto, 39th Chapter, 34th

verse of Srimad-Bhiigavatam. When Kr�pa was going to Mathura, all

of the gopis were standing behind Kr�pa, and upon seeing the chariot

leaving, they stood there stunned and did not move. They remained
like that until the flag of the chariot and the dust thrown up by its
wheels became invisible.
Kr�pa was once addressed by His friend thus: "My dear Mukunda
[Kr�pa], due to their being separated from You, the cowherd boys
are standing just like neglected Deities in the house of a professional

briihmal)a." There is a class of professional brahmal)as who take to

Deity worship as a means of earning their livelihood. Brahmal)as in
this class are not very interested in the Deity; they are interested
mainly in the money they can earn as holy men. So the Deities wor­

shiped by such professional brahmal)aS are not properly decorated,
Their dress is not changed, and Their bodies are not cleaned. They

look dirty and are not very attractive. Actually, Deity worship
should be done very carefully: the dress should be changed daily,
and as far as possible there should be ornaments. Everything should
be so clean that the Diety is attractive to all visitors. Here the
example is given of the Deities in the house of a professional brah­

mal)a because such Deities are not at all attractive. The friends of
Kr�pa, in the absence of Kr�pa, were appearing like such neglected
Deities.

257

The Nectar of Devotion

Bashfulness
When Radhara:p.i was first introduced to Kr��a, She felt very bash­

ful. One of Her friends addressed Her in this way: "My dear friend,

You have already sold Yourself and all Your beauty to Govinda. Now

You should not be bashful. Please look upon Him cheerfully. One

who has sold an elephant to another person should not make a miser­

ly quarrel about selling the trident which controls the elephant."

This kind of 'bashfulness is due to a new introduction-in ecstatic love
with Kr��a.

The heavenly King, Indra, upon being defeated in his fight with

Kr�p.a for possession of the purijuta flower, became very bashful be­

cause of his defeat. He was standing before Kr��a, bowing down his
head, when Kr��a said, "All right, Indra, you can take this piirijiita

flower. Otherwise, you will not be able to show your face before
your wife, Sacidevi." lndra's bashfulness was due to defeat. In an­

other instance, Kr�p.a began to praise U ddhava for his various high

qualifications. Upon being praised by Kr��a, Uddhava also bowed

down his head bashfully.

In Hari-varhsa, Satyabhama, feeling slighted by Rukmi�i's high

position, said, "My dear Krwa, the Raivataka Mountain 'is always full
of spring flowers, but when I have become persona non grata to You,

what is the use of my observing them?" This is an instance of bash­
fulness resulting from being defeated.

Concealment
There is a symptom of ecstatic love known as concealment, or try­
ing to hide one's real mental condition by externally showing another

attitude. In this state of mind one tries to hide his mind by looking
away in different directions, by unnecessarily trying for something

which is impossible, or by using words which cover one's real

thoughts. According to ucuryas expert in the study of psychological
activities, these attempts at hiding one's real affections are another
part of ecstatic feeling for Kr��a.
In

the

Tenth

Canto,

32nd

Chapter,

14th

verse

of

Srimad-

Further Features of Ecstatic Love for Kr§rza

258

Bhiigavatam, Sukadeva Gosvaml states, "My dear King, the gopis

were always beautiful and decorated with confidential smiles and

alluring garments. In their movements, intended to give impetus to
lusty feelings, they would sometimes press Krwa's hand on their laps,

and sometimes they would keep His lotus feet on their breasts. After

doing this, they would talk with Kn;�a as if they were very angry
with Him."

There is another instance of this concealment in ecstatic love.

When Kr9�a, the supreme joker, planted the piirijiita tree in the
courtyard of Satyabhama, Rukmi�l, the daughter of King Vi'rabhadra,

became very angry, but due to her natural gentle behavior, she did

not express anything. No one could understand Rukmi�l's real men­

tal condition. This is an instance of competitive concealment.

There is another instance in the First Canto, llth Chapter, 28th

verse of Srimad-Bhiigavatam. After entering Dvaraka, Kr9�a was re­

ceived in different ways by different members of His family. Upon

seeing their husband from a distance, the queens of Dvaraka im­

mediately embraced Him within their minds and slowly glanced over
Him. As Kr9�a came nearer, they pushed their sons forward to em­

brace Him. Others were trying, out of shyness, not to shed tears,

but they still could not keep the tears from gliding down. This is an
instance of concealment caused by shyness.

On another occasion, when Srlmatl Radhara�l thought that Kr9�a

was involved with another woman, She addressed Her friend in this

manner: "My dear friend, as soon as I think of Kr9�a the cowherd
boy attached to some other woman, I become stricken with fearful­

ness and the hairs on My body stand up. I must be very careful that
Kr��a will not see Me at such times." This is an instance of conceal­

ment caused by shyness and diplomatic behavior.

It has been stated: "Although Srlmatl Radhara�l developed a deep

loving affection for Krwa, She hid Her attitude in the core of Her

heart so that others could not detect Her actual condition." This is
an instance of concealment caused by gentleness.

Once when Kr9�a and His cowherd friends were enjoying friendly

conversation, Kr9�a began to address His associates in casual lan­

guage. At that time Kr9�a's servant, Patrl, was also enjoying the con-

259

The Nectar of Devotion

versation. But then, rem�mbering his position of servitude, Patri
bowed down before his master, and with great respect and control,
he stifled his smiling. This subdued smiling is an instance of con­
cealment caused by a respectful attitude.
Remembering

There are many symptoms of ecstatic love caused by remembering

Kr�!la. For example, one friend of Kr�!la informed Him, "My dear

Mukunda, just after observing a bluish cloud in the sky, the lotus­

eyed Radhara!li immediately began to remember You. And simply

by observing this cloud She became lusty for Your association." This
is an instance of remembering Kr�!la in ecstatic love because of seeing

something resembling Him. Kr�!la's bodily complexion is very similar
to the bluish hue of a cloud, so simply by observing a bluish cloud,
Srimati Radhara!li remembered Him.

One devotee said that even when he was not very attentive he

would sometimes, seemingly out of madness, remember the lotus
feet of Krsna within his heart. This is an instance of remembrance re.

.

.

suiting from constant practice. In other words, devotees who are con­

stantly thinking of the lotus feet of Kr�!la, even if they are momen­

tarily inattentive, will see the figure of Lord Kr�!la appearing within
their hearts.

Argumentativeness

Madhumangala was an intimate friend of Kr�!la coming from the

briihma!'-a community. Kr�!ia's friends were mostly cowherd boys be­

longing to the vaisya community, but there were others who belonged
to the briihmarw community. Actually, in Vrndavana

the vaisya

community and the briihmar-a community are considered prominent.
This Madhumangala one day addressed Kr�!la in this fashion: "My

dear friend, I can see that You are not aware of the peacock feathers
that are falling on the ground, and at the same time You are unmind­

ful of the flower garlands which are offered to You. I think I can
guess the reason for Your absent-mindedness when I see Your two

260

eyes flying over to the eyes of Srimati Radhara!!-1, just like black

drones flying to lotus flowers." This is an instance of an argumenta­

tive suggestion in ecstatic love.

Once while Kr�!la was out walking, one of the associates of Radha­

ra!l-1 told Her: "My dear friend, do You think that this walking per­
sonality is a tiimala tree?* If He is a tiimala tree, then how is it possible

for Him to walk and be so beautiful? Then, this personality might be

a cloud. But if He's a cloud, then where is the beautiful moon

within? Under the circumstances, I think it may be granted that this

person is the same enchanting Personality of Godhead by whose flute

vibration the three worlds are captivated. He must be the same

Mukunda who is standing before Govardhan Hill." This is another

instance of an argumentative presentation of ecstatic love.
Anxiety

In

the

Tenth

Canto,

29th

Chapter,

26th verse of Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, when Kr�!ia asked all the gopis to go back to their

homes, they did not like it. Because of their grief at this, they were

sighing heavily, and their beautiful faces appeared to be drying up.

In this condition they remained, without making a sound. They be­

gan to draw lines on the ground with their toes, and with their tears
they washed the black ointment from their eyes onto their breasts,

which were covered with red kurikuma powder. This is an instance of

anxiety in ecstatic love.

One of the friends of Kr�!la once informed Him, "My dear killer of

the demon Mura, Your kind and gentle mother is very anxious be­

cause You have not returned home, and with great difficulty she has

passed the evening constantly sitting on the corridor platform of

Your home. It is certainly astonishing how You could forget Your

mother while You are off somewhere engaged in Your playful activi­
ties!" This is another instance of deep anxiety in ecstatic love.

When Mother Yasoda was very anxiously waiting for Krwa to re­

turn from Mathura, Maharaj Nanda gave her this solace: "My dear
*

The tiimala tree is always described as being the same color as Krwa.

The Nectar of Devotion

261

Yasoda, please don't be worried. Please dry your beautiful lotus-like
face. There is no need for you to breathe so hotly. I will go imme­
diately with Akrura to the palace of Kamsa and get your son back
for you." Here is an instance of anxiety in ecstatic love caused by
Kr��a's awkward position.
Thoughtfulness

In the Vaisiikha-miihiitmya section of the Padma Puriirw a devotee

states that though in some of the eighteen Puriirws the process of

glorifying Lord Vi��u is not mentioned, and the glorifying of some
demigod is offered, such glorification must be continued for millions

of years. For when one studies the Puriirws very scrutinizingly, he can
see that, ultimately, Lord Vi��u is the Supreme Personality of God­
head. This is an instance of ecstatic love developed out of thought­
fulness.
In

the

Tenth

Canto,

68th

Chapter,

30th

verse of Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, there is an account of Rukmi�'idevi's writing a letter to

Kr��a requesting Him to kidnap her before her marriage to another
person. At that time the specific attachment of Rukmi�'i for Krwa
was expressed by Rukmi�'i as follows: "My dear Lord Kr��a, Your
transcendental glories are chanted by great sages who are free from
material contamination, and in exchange for such. glorification You
are so kind that You freely distribute Yourself to such devotees. As
one can elevate oneself simply by Your grace, so also by Your direc­
tion alone one may be lost to all benedictions under the influence of
eternal time. Therefore I have selected Your lordship as my hus­
band, brushing aside personalities like Brahma and lndra-not to
mention others." Rukmi�'i enhanced her love for Krwa simply by
thinking of Him. This is an instance of thoughtfulness in ecstatic
love.
Endurance

When a person is fully satisfied due to attaining knowledge, tran­
scending all distress, or achieving his desired goal of life in transcen-

Further Features of Ecstatic Love for Krrra

262

dental devotional service to God-at that time his state of endurance

or steady mind is called dhrti. At this stage one is not perturbed by
any amount of loss, nor does anything appear to be unachieved by
him.
According to the opinion of Bhartrhari, the learned scholar, when
a person is elevated to this state of endurance, he thinks as follows:
"I do not wish to be a highly posted government servant. I shall be
satisfied even if I have to eat food collected by begging. I shall prefer
to remain naked, without proper dress of garments. I shall prefer to
lie down on the ground without any matress. And despite all these
disadvantages, I shall refuse to serve anyone, not even the govern·
ment." In other words, when one is in ecstatic love with the Person­
ality of Godhead, he can endure any kind of disadvantages calculated
under the material concept of life.
Nanda Maharaj, the father of Kn;�a, used to think: "In my pas­
turing ground the goddess of fortune is personally present, and I
possess. more than ten hundred_ thousand cows which loiter here and
there. And above all, I have a· son like Kr��a, who is such a powerful,
wonderful worker. Therefore, even though I am a householder, I am
feeling so satisfied!" This is an instance of mental endurance resulting
from the absence of all distress.
In another instance a devotee says, "I am always swimming in the
nectarean ocean of the pastimes of the Personality of Godhead, and
as such I have no more attraction for religious rituals, economic de­
velopment, sense gratification, or even the ultimate salvation of

merging into the existence of Brahman." This is an instance of the

mind's endurance due to achieving the best thing in the world. The
best thing in the world is absorption in Kr��a consciousness.
Happmess
-

It is described in the Vi§[!-U Puriir-a that when Akrura came to take
Krwa and Balarama to Mathura, just by seeing Their faces he became
so cheerful that all over his body there were symptoms of ecstatic
love. This state is called happiness.

It is stated in the Tenth Canto, 33rd Chapter, 12th verse of Srimad-

263

The Nectar of Devotionc,

Bhiigavatam: "Upon seeing that Kr��a's arm was placed on her shoul­

der, one of the gopis engaged in the rasa dance became so ecstatically

happy that she kissed Krwa on His cheek." This is an instance of

feeling happiness because of achieving a desired goal.
Eagerness
In

the

Tenth

Canto,

7lst

Chapter,

29th verse of

Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, it is said: "When Kr9�a first came from His Kingdom,

Dvaraka, to lndraprastha;* the young females of the city became so

eager to see Him that even at night, when they were lying down with
their husbands, they could not restrain their eagerness. Even though

they were not properly dressed and although their hair was loose and

there were many household duties to perform, they still gave up
everything and immediately went into the street to see Krwa." This
is an instance of eagerness of ecstatic love.

In his book Staviivali, Sri Rupa Gosvami has prayed for the mercy

of Radharapi, who was so captivated by-the flute vibrations of Kr9�a
that She immediately asked information of His whereabouts from
residents in the V rndavana forest. Upon first seeing Krwa, She was

filled with such ecstatic love and pleasure that She began to scratch
her ears. The damsels of Braja and Radhara�i were very expert in

talking cunningly, so as soon as they saw Kr9�a they began their
talkings; and Kr9�a, pretending to go for some flowers for them,

immediately left that place and entered into a mountain cave. This

is another instance of eager loving exchanges on the parts of both the

gopis and Kr9�a.

When Kr9�a was fighting with the Kaliya snake by dancing on his
heads, Kaliya bit Krwa on the leg. At that time Garu9a became in­
furiated and began to murmur: "Krwa is so powerful that simply by
His thundering voice the wives of Kaliya have had miscarriages. Be­

cause my Lord has been insulted by this snake, I wish to immediately

devour him, but I cannot do so in the presence of my Lord, because
He may become angry with me." This is an instance of eagerness to

act in ecstatic love as a result of dishonor to Kr9�a.

lndraprastha is the present-day Delhi.

When Sisupala objected to the worship of Kr9t;ta in the riija-siiya

arena at a sacrifice organized by Maharaj Yudhi9thira, N akula, the

younger brother of Arjuna, said, "A person who cannot tolerate the
worship of Kr9t;ta is my enemy and is possessed of a demonic nature.

Therefore I wish to -strike my ieft foot upon his broad head, juBt to

punish him more strongly than the wand of Yamaraja!" Then Nakula
began to lament like this: "0, all auspiciousness to Lord Kr�t;ta! I am

so surprised to see that the condemned descendants of the Kuru
dynasty, who so unlawfully occupied the throne of the Kuru king­

dom, are at the same time criticizing Kr�t;ta with diplomatic devices.
0, this is intolerable!" This is another instance of eagerness caused
by dishonor to Kr9t;ta.

Haughtiness, Resulting in Dishonorable Words
In the

Vidagdha-miidhava, Kutila, a sister-in-law of Radharat;ti,

began to criticize Kr9t;ta in this way: "Kr9t;ta, You are standing here,

and Radharat;ti, who has just been married to my brother, is also

standing here. Now I know both of You very well, so why should I not
be very anxious to protect my sister-in-law from Your dancing eyes?"

This is an instance of dishonorable words used to indirectly criticize

Kr9t;ta.

Similarly, some of the gopis once began to address Kr9t;ta with

these dishonorable words: "My dear Krwa, You are a first-class thief.

So please leave this place immediately. We know You love Candravali
more than us, but there is no use in praising her in our presence!

Kindly do not contaminate the name of Radharat;ti in this place!"

This is another instance of dishonorable words cast upon Kr9t;ta in
ecstatic love.

There is another statement in the Tenth Canto, 31st Chapter, 16th

verse of Srimad-Bhiigavatam. When all the gopis came out of their

homes to meet Kr�t;ta in the Vrndavana forest, Krwa refused to

accept them and asked them to go home, giving them some moral
instruction. At that time the gopis began to speak as follows: "My

dear Kr�t;ta, there is extreme distress in being out of Your presence,

and there is extreme happiness simply in seeing You. Therefore we

have all left our husbands, relatives, brothers and friends and have

-265

The Nectar of Devotion

simply come to You, being captivated by the sound of Your tran­

scendental flute. 0 infallible one, You had better know what is the

reason for our coming here. In plain words, we are here simply be­

cause we have been captivated by the sweet sound of Your flute. We

are all beautiful girls, and You are so foolish that You are rejecting

our association. We do not know anyone, other than Yourself, who
would miss this opportunity to associate with young girls in the dead

of night!" This is another instance of indirect insults used against
Kr��a in ecstatic love.

In the Padyiivali, one of the friends of Radhara�i once addressed

Her thusly: "My dear friend, please do not be too puffed up because

Kr��a has decorated Your forehead with His own hand. It may be

that Kr��a is yet attracted by some other beautiful girl. I see that the

decoration on Your forehead is very nicely made, and so it appears

that Kr��a was not too disturbed in painting it. Otherwise, he could

not have painted such exact lines!" This is an instance of indirect
dishonor caused by Radha's good fortune.

In the Tenth Canto, 30th Chapter, 26th verse of Srimad­
Bhiigavatam there is the following statement: "When the gopis were
searching after Kr��a and Radha after the riisa dance, they thus began
to speak amongst themselves: 'We have seen the footprints of Kr��a

and Radha on the ground of Vrndavana, and they are giving us great

pain, because Kr��a is everything to us. But that girl is so cunning

that She has taken Him away alone and is enjoying His kissing with­
out sharing Him with us!"' This is another instance of casting dis­

honorable words against Kr��a and Radha, pouting over the good
fortune of Srimati Radhara�i.

Envy

Sometimes when the cowherd boys used to play in the forests of

Vrndavana, Kr��a would play on one side, and Balarama would play

on another. There would be competition and mock fighting between
the two parties, and when Krwa's party was defeated by Balarama,

the boys would say, "If Balarama's party remains victorious, then
who in the world can be weaker than ourselves?" This is an instance
of envy in ecstatic love.

Impudence

In the Tenth Canto, 52nd Chapter, 33rd verse of the Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, Rukmi�i addresses a letter to Krwa as follows: "My

dear unconquerable Kr��a, my marriage day is fixed for tomorrow. I
request that You come to the city of Vidarbha without advertising
Yourself. Then have Your soldiers and commanders suddenly sur­

round and defeat all the strength of the King of Magadha and by thus

adopting the methods of the demons, please kidnap and marry me."

According to the Vedic system there are eight kinds of marriages,

out of which one is called riik§aSa-viviiha. Riik§asa-viviiha refers to kid­

napping a girl and marrying her by force and is considered to be a

demonic method. When Rukmi�i was going to be married to Sisupala

by the choice of her elder brother, she wrote the above letter to
Kr��a requesting Him to kidnap her. This is an instance of impudence

in ecstatic love for Krsna.
.

.

.

One of the gopis said, "May Kr��a's sweet flute be washed away by
the waves of the Yamuna, and let it fall into the ocean! The sweet

sound of that flute is so impudent that it makes us lose all composure

before our superiors."
Dizziness

Every evening at sunset Kr��a used to return from the pasturing

ground where He herded cows. Sometimes when Mother Yasoda

could not hear the sweet vibration of His flute she would become very
anxious, and because of this she would feel dizzy. Thus, dizziness

caused by anxiety in ecstatic love for Kr��a is also possible.

When Yasoda had tied Kr��a up one time, she began to think,

"Kr��a's body is so soft and delicate, how co!lld I have tied Him with
rope?" Thinking this, her brain became puzzled, and she felt dizzi­
ness.
The gopis were advised by their superiors to bolt the doors at

night, but they were so carefree that they did not carry out this order

very rigidly. Sometimes, by thinking of Krwa, they became so con­

fident of being out of all danger that they would lie down at night in
the courtyards of their houses. This is an instance of dizziness in

267

The Nectar of Devotion

ecstatic love due to natural affection for Kr�l).a.

It may be questioned why devotees of Kr�l).a should be attacked by

dizziness, which is usually considered a sign of the modes of igno­

rance. To answer this question, Sri Jiva Gosvami has said that the

devotees of Lord Krwa are always transcendental to all the modes of

material nature; when they feel dizziness or go to sleep, they are not

considered to be sleeping under the modes of nature, but are ac­

cepted as being in a trance of devotional service. There is an authori­

tative statement in the GarU<}a Puriirw about mystic yogis who are

under the direct shelter of the Supreme Personality of Godhead: "In
all three stages of their consciousness-namely, wakefulness, dreaming

and deep sleep-the devotees are absorbed in the thought of the Su­

preme Personality of Godhead. Therefore, in their complete absorp­

tion in the thought of Kr�l).a, they do not sleep."
Alertness

A devotee once stated, "I have already conquered the modes of ig­

norance, and I am now on the platform of transcendental knowledge.
Therefore I shall be engaged only in searching after the Supreme

Personality of Godhead." This is an instance of alertness in ecstatic

love. Transcendental alertness is possible when the illusory condition
is completely overcome. At that stage, when in contact with any re­

action of material elements, such as sound, smell, touch or taste, the
devotee realizes the transcendental presence of the Supreme Person­

ality of Godhead. In this condition the ecstatic symptoms (i.e. stand�

ing of the hair on the body, rolling of the eyeballs and getting up
from sleep) are persistently visible.

When Srimati Radhariil).i first saw Kr�l).a, She suddenly became

conscious of all transcendental happiness, and the functions of Her
different limbs were stunned. When Lalita, Her constant companion,

whispered into Her ear the holy name of Kr�l).a, Radhariil).i imme­

diately opened Her eyes wide. This is an instance of alertness caused
by hearing the sound of Kr�l).a 's name.

One day, in a joking mood, Kr�l).a informed Radhariil).i, "My dear

Radhariil).i, I am going to give up Your company." Upon saying this,

Further Features of Ecstatic Love for K[§[W

268

He immediately disappeared, and because of this Radharapi became

so afflicted that the hue of Her body changed, and She immediately

fell down upon the ground of Vrndavana. She had practically stopped

breathing, but when She smelled the flavor of the flowers on the

ground, She awoke in ecstasy and got up. This is an instance of tran­

scendental alertness caused by smelling.

When Kr�pa was touching the body of one gopi, the gopi began to

address her companion thus: "My dear friend, whose hand is this

touching my body? I had become very afraid after seeing the dark­

ened forest on the bank of the Yamuna, but suddenly the touch of

this hand has saved me from hysterical fits." This is an instance of
alertness caused by touching.

One of the gopis informed Kr�pa, "My dear Krwa, when You dis­
appeared from the arena of the riisa dance, our most dear friend,
Radharapi, immediately fell on the ground and lost consciousness.

But after this, when I offered Her some of Your chewed betel nut
remnants, She immediately returned to consciousness with jubilant

symptoms

One night .Srimati Radharapi was talking in a dream. "My dear

Krwa," She said. "Please do not play any more jokes on Me! Please
stop! And please don't touch My garments either. Otherwise I shall

inform the elderly persons, and I shall disclose all of Your naughty

behavior." While She was talking like this in a dream, She suddenly

awoke and saw some of Her superiors standing before Her. Thus
Radharapi became ashamed and bowed Her head. This is an instance

of alertness after awakening from sleep.

There is another instance of this. A messenger from Kr�pa came to

Srimati Radharapi while She was sleeping, and Radharapi immediately
awakened. Similarly, when Kr�pa began to blow on His flute in the
night, all of the gopis, the beautiful daughters of the cowherd men,

immediately got up from their sleep. There is a very beautiful com­

parison made in this connection: "The lotus flower is sometimes sur­

rounded by white swans, and sometimes it is surrounded by black
wasps who are collecting its honey. When there is a thundering in the
sky, the swans go away, but the black wasps stay to enjoy the lotus

'

flowers." The gopis' sleeping condition is compared to the white
swans, and the sound of Kr��a's flute is compared to a black wasp.
When Kr��a's flute sounded, the white swans, which represent the
sleeping condition of the gopis, were immediately vanquished, and
the black wasp sound of the flute began to enjoy the lotus flower of
the gopis' beauty.

31 I Additional Symptoms

All the above-mentioned thirty-one symptoms of ecstatic love are

called vyabhiciiri, or disturbing. All these symptoms refer to appar­

ently disturbed conditions, but even in such disturbed conditions

there is acute ecstatic love for Kn;pa. These symptoms, however, can
be divided into three groups: first class, second class and third. There
are many other disturbing symptoms in ecstatic love, such as envy,

anxiety, pride, jealousy, conclusion, cowardliness, forgiveness, impa­

tience, hankering, regret, doubtfulness and impudence. These are in­

cluded in all the thirty-one conditions of ecstatic love. Srila Riipa

Gosvami has very nicely analyzed the different kinds of disturbing

symptoms, and although it is very difficult to find the exact English

equivalents for many Sanskrit words used here, his analysis will now

be presented.

When one becomes malicious upon seeing another's advancement

of life, his state of mind is generally called envy. When one becomes
frightened at seeing a lightning bolt in the sky, that fearfulness brings
on anxiety. Therefore, fearfulness and anxiety can be taken as one.

When someone wants to hide his real mentality, it is called avahittha,

or concealment. When a person wants to exhibit superiority, it is

called pride. Both of these can be classified under pretension. In a
pretentious attitude both avahittha and pride are to be found. When

one cannot tolerate an offense committed by another, it is called

amar§a, and when one cannot tolerate the opulence of another it is

called jealousy. Jealousy and amar§a are both caused by intolerance.

When one is able to establish the correct import of a word, it can be
called conclusiveness. And before such a conclusive determination of
270

271

The Nectar of Devotion

import, there must be thoughtful consideration. Therefore, the act of
consideration is present during the establishment of a conclusion.

When one presents himself as ignorant, it is called humility, and when
there is absence of enthusiasm it is called cowardice. Therefore, in

humility, there is cowardice also. When the mind is steadfast it is
called enduring, and when one can tolerate others' offenses, that is

called endurance. Therefore, forgiveness and endurance can be sy­

nonymous. When one becomes anxious for time to pass, that is called

impatience, and when one sees something wonderful one is said to be

struck with wonder. Impatience may be caused by being struck with

wonder, and so impatience and being struck with wonder can be
synonymous. When anxiety is in its dormant stage it is called hanker­

ing. Therefore, anxiety and hankering can also be synonymous. When

one becomes regretful for some offense, his feeling is called bashful­
ness. In this way, bashfulness and regret can be synonymous. Doubt­

fulness is one of the aspects of argument. After exhibiting impudence

one becomes restless. Therefore restlessness and impudence can be

synonymous.

When all such symptoms are included in ecstatic love, they are

called aficiiri, or continuously existing ecstatic symptoms. All of

these symptoms are transcendental, and they are exhibited in differ­

ent ways, acting and interacting under different conditions. They are

like the reciprocation of love between the lover and beloved.

When a person is envious or defamed, there may be a change in the

color of the body. This can be classified as vibhiiva, or sub-ecstasy.

Sometimes illusion, collapse and strong anxiety are also considered

to be vibhiiva. When there are many such symptoms, they can simply

be gr ouped together under ecstatic love.

Srila Rupa Gosvami says that fright, sleep, fatigue, laziness and the

madness of intoxication are sometimes grouped under continuous

symptoms of ecstatic love, and they are due to a strong attraction.

False argument, determination, steadiness, remembrance, joyful­

ness, ignorance, humility and unconsciousness are also different syl11P­

toms of ecstatic love. Dependence is also grouped under ecstatic love,

and this can be divided into superior dependence and inferior depen­

dence. The direct differentiations between superior and inferior

Additional Symptoms

272

dependence are ascertained by Riipa Gosvami and will be presented

in due course.

One devotee exclaimed, "Oh, I cannot see the district of Mathura!

Even though by simply hearing the name of Mathura the hairs of my

body are standing up, I cannot see the place. So of what use are my

eyes?" This statement reveals a strong anxiety to see the district of

Mathura resulting from a strong attachment to Kr�pa. There is another
instance of this strong attachment for Kr�pa expressed by Bhima

when he began to murmur, "My arms are just like thunderbolts, but

despite these arms I could not smash Sisupala while he was blasphem­

ing Kr�pa. Therefore, of what use are these strong arms?" In this

instance Bhima became angry, and, being influenced by such anger,

his hopelessness became a cause for strong attachment to Kr�pa. This

instance can be described as strong attachment for Kr�pa in anger.

When Arjuna witnessed the universal form of Kr�pa, whose daz­

zling teeth were practically devouring the very existence of the

universe, Arjuna's mouth became dried up. At that time Arjuna for­

got himself and could not understand that he was Arjuna, Kr�pa's
friend, although he was always dependent upon Kr�pa's mercy. This

incident is an example of inferior dependence.

Sometimes ghastly activities also support strong ecstatic love for

Krsna. This state of mind is called ecstatic fearfulness under illu.sion.
·
I� the Tenth Canto, 23rd Chapter, 32nd verse of Srimad-Bhiigavatam

there is the following statement by the briihmar-as who were perform­

ing sacrifices: "We have all been born into three advantageous condi­

tions: we are in high briihmar-a families, we have ceremoniously re­

ceived the sacred thre;td, and we are also properly initiated by a

spiritual master. But, alas, in spite of all these advantages, we are
condemned. Even our observance of brahmacarya [celibacy] is con­

demned.'· The briihmar-as thus began to condemn their own activities.

They realized that in spite of being so elevated by birth, education

and culture, they still were under the spell of the illusory energy.

They also admitted that even great yogis who are not devotees of the
Lord are covered by the influence of material energy. This kind of

hopelessness felt by the briihmar-as who were performing ritualistic

273

The Nectar of Devotion

ceremonies shows practically no attachment for Krwa. There is an­
other hopelessness, however, which shows attachment for Kr�!la.
When the bull demon attacked the damsels of Braja, they began to
cry out, "My dear Kr�!la-please save us! We are now gone!" This is
hopelessness with attachment for Kr�!la.
When the Kes'i demon was assassinated by Kr�!la, Kamsa be�ame
hopeless. He began to say, "Kes'idaitya was as dear to me as my own
life, but he has been killed by some cowherd boy who is crude, un­
educated and ignorant of fighting. Even though I have defeated the
King of heaven without difficulty, still I do not know the value of
life." Because this hopelessness has a slight touch of attraction for

Kr�!la, it is considered to be a reflection of ecstatic love in hopeless­

ness.
Kamsa once rebuked Akrura by saying, "You are such a fool that
you are accepting the Supreme Personality of Godhead to be a cow­
herd boy, simply because He has defeated some harmless water snake!
The boy may have lifted one pebble called Govardhan Hill, but what
is more surprising than that is your statement that this boy is the
Personality of Godhead!" This is an instance of a maliciously op­
posing element, caused by hopelessness in ecstatic love for Kr9!1a.
One devotee tried to console a kadamba tree when the tree was
lamenting because Kr�!la had not touched even its shadow. The devo­
tee said, "My dear kadamba tree, do not be worried. Just after de­
feating the Kaliya snake in the Yamuna River, Kr�!la will come and
satisfy your desire." This is an instance of inappropriate hopelessness
in ecstatic love for Kr�!la.
Garu�a, the eagle, the carrier of Vi9!lu, once said, "Who can be
more pure than I? Where is there a second bird like me, so able and
competent? Kr9!1a may not like me; He may not wish to join my
party, but still He has to take advantage of my wings!" This is an
instance of hopelessness in the neutral mood of ecstatic love.
The symptoms of ecstatic love are sometimes grouped under four
headings-namely, generation, conjunction, aggregation and satisfac­
tion.
Kr9!1a once told Radhara!l-1, "My dear friend, when You tried to

in this way, Radhara!li moved her beautiful eyebrows crossly. Riipa

Gosvami prays that everyone may become blessed by this movement
of Srimati Radharii!J.i's eyebrows. This is an instance of the generation
of malice in ecstatic love of Krwa.

One night, after the Piitana demon had been killed, baby Kr�!la

could be seen playing upon her breast. Upon seeing this, Yasoda be­

came stunned for some time. This is an example of a conjunction of

various symptoms of ecstatic love. The conjunction can be auspicious
or inauspicious. That the Piitana demon had been killed was auspi­

cious, but that Krwa was playing on her breast in the dead of night,

with no one to help Him in case of trouble, was inauspicious. Yasoda
was caught between auspiciousness and inauspiciousness.
After Krwa had just learned to walk, He was going in and out of

the house very frequently. Yasoda became surprised and said, "This
child is too restless and cannot be controlled! He is incessantly going

about the neighborhood of Gokula [Vrndavana], and then He is
coming back inside the house. I see that the child is very fearless, but
in spite of His fearlessness, I am becoming more and more afraid of
His falling into some danger." This again is an instance of the con­

junction of two opposing elements: the child was very fearless, but at
the same time Yasoda was becoming fearful of some danger. Here
danger is the cause, and Yasoda's feelings are in conjunction of two

opposing symptoms. In other words, Yasoda was feeling both happi­
ness and doubt, or growing fear.

When Devaki, the mother of Kr�!J.a, saw her son very jubilant in the
presence of the wrestlers in Kamsa's arena, two kinds of tears were

simultaneously gliding down her cheeks: sometimes her tears were
warm, and sometimes they were cold. This is an instance of a con­
junction of jubilation and lamentation due to different causes of ec­
static love.
Once when Srimati Radharii!J.i was standing on the bank of the
Yamuna River in the forest of Vrndavana, She was attacked by Kr�!J.a,
who was stronger than She. Although She externally expressed a dis­

turbed mood from this incident, within Herself She was smiling and

feeling great satisfaction. Externally She moved Her eyebrows and
made a show of rejecting Krwa. In this mood Radhara!li looked very

beautiful, and Srila Riipa Gosvami glorified Her beauty. This is an

275

The Nectar of Devotion

instance of exhibiting varying feelings in ecstatic love, although the

cause is one only-Kr�!la.

Sometimes there were great festivals in the house of Nanda

Maharaj, and all of the inhabitants of Vrndavana would assemble for
these festivals. During one such festival, Srimati Radhara!li was seen

wearing a golden necklace given Her by Kr�!la. This was immediately
detected by Mother Yasoda as well as by Radhara!!i's mother, because

the necklace was too long for Radhara!!i's neck. At the same time
Radhara!li could see Kr�!!a nearby, as well as Her own husband,

Abhimanyu. So all of these things combined to make Radhara!li feel

very much ashamed, and with Her face shrivelled She began to look
very beautiful. In this case there was a combination of bashfulness,

anger, jubilation and lamentation. This is an instance of an aggregate
of symptoms of ecstatic love.

Kamsa once said, "What harm can this boy do to me? He has no

power." The next moment Kamsa was informed that all of his friends
had been killed by the boy. Then Kamsa began to think in perplexity,

"Shall I go immediately and surrender unto Him? But how can a

great warrior do this?" The next moment he thought, "Why should I

be afraid of Him? There are still so many wrestlers standing to sup­

port me." But the next moment he began to consider: "The boy is

certainly not common, because He has lifted Govardhan Hill with His

left hand. So what can I do in this connection? Let me go to Vrnda­

vana and inflict pains on all the residents there. But still I cannot even

go out, because my heart is trembling from fear of this boy!" This

condition of Kamsa's mind reveals an instance of pride, lamentation,
humility, determination, remembrance, doubtfulness, anger and fear.

Actually eight different symptoms comprised the mental condition of
Kamsa. This is another instance of an aggregate of symptoms in hope­

less ecstatic love.

One householder devotee once said, "My Lord, I am so wretched

that these two eyes are never desiring to see the glorious city of

Mathura. Therefore, my eyes are actually condemned. I am nicely
educated, but my education has simply been used in government
service. I have not considered formidable time, stronger than any­

thing else, which creates and annihilates everything. To whom shall I

Additional Symptoms

276

leave all of my wealth and fortune? I am becoming older and older.

What shall I do? Shall I execute devotional service from here at home?
This I cannot do, because my mind is being attracted by the transcen­

dental land of v rndavana."

This is an instance of hopelessness, pride, doubtfulness, patience,

lamentation, determination and eagerness-an aggregation of seven

different symptoms in ecstatic love for Krwa.

There is a proverb in Sanskrit which says, "Disappointment gives

rise to the greatest satisfaction." In other words, when one's senti­

ment or ambition becomes too great and is not fulfilled until after

seemingly hopeless tribulation, that is taken as the greatest satisfac­

tion. Once the cowherd boys in V rndavana were vainly searching
after Kr�tta for a long time, and for that reason their faces became

blackened, and their complexions appeared faded. Just then they
could hear on the hill a faint vibration from Krwa's flute. Imme­

diately all of them became very much engladdened. This is an in­

stance of satisfaction in the midst of disappointment.

Srila Rilpa Gosvami says that although he has no expert knowledge

about the sounds and meanings and mellows of the symptoms of

ecstatic love, he has tried to give some examples of different varieties

of love of Kr�tJ.a. He further states that the thirty-one disturbing

symptoms of ecstatic love, plus nine other symptoms, all taken to­

gether equal forty primary symptoms of ecstatic love. These symp­

toms create transformations of bodily activities as well as movements

of the senses. All of them can be accepted as different feelings of the

heart. Sometimes some of the feelings are quite natural. Sometimes

some of the feelings are just temporary appearances. Those symp­

toms which are very natural always remain, both within and without
the devotee.
As one can detect the color of dye a cloth was soaked in by look­

ing at the cloth, so, simply by understanding the different signs of

these symptomatic features, one can understand the actual position.

In other words, although attachment for Kr�tta is one, nevertheless,

because there exist different kinds of devotees, such attachment is
manifested in many varieties. As clothing tinged red appears red, so

the temporary appearance of a certain type of feeling can be detected

(

The Nectar of Devotion

or observed by the specific ecstatic symptom. In fact, all the different
humors and mellows of the devotees possess various specific feelings
within the mind. And, according to these differences, the symptoms
of ecstatic love appear in different forms and degrees. If one's heart
is highly elevated, grave and magnanimous, or if one's heart is rough
and crude, different symptoms of ecstatic love will appear, influenced
by the condition of the heart. Actually, people cannot generally
understand such different qualities of mentality, but when one's heart
is very soft or gentle, these symptoms become very easily visible, and
one can understand very clearly. The heart of o:1.e who is highly ele­
vated and grave is compared with gold. If one's heart is very soft and
gentle, his heart is compared with a cotton swab. When there is an
ecstatic sensation within the mind, the golden heart or grave heart is
not agitated, but the soft heart immediately becomes agitated.
To offer another example, a grave, magnanimous heart is compared
to a great city, and a soft heart to an insignificant cottage. There may
be many lights, or even great elephants in the big city, but no one will
take particular notice of them. But when such lights or elephants are
seen near a small cottage, everyone can distinctly point them out.
Hardness of the heart is compared to a lightning bolt, with gold
and with shellac. The lightning bolt is very strong and never becomes
soft. Similarly, the hearts of those who are engaged in severe austeri­
ties and penances do not become very easily softened. The golden
�eart becomes melted at high temperature, as in ecstatic love. And
fhe shellac heart is very easily melted in slight temperature.
Softness of the heart is compared with honey, with butter and with
nectar. And the condition of the mind is compared with sunshine. As
honey and butter become melted even in slight sunshine, so soft­
hearted persons become easily melted. Nectar, however, is by its na­

ture always liquid. And the hearts of those who are in pure ecstatic
love with Krwa are by nature always liquified, just like nectar.
A pure devotee of Kr9!ia is always specifically qualified with nec­
tarean qualifications and sometimes with the qualifications of butter
and honey. On the whole, all the different conditions of the heart

mentioned above can be melted under certain circumstances, just as
a hard diamond sometimes is melted by a combination of certain

Additional Symptoms

278

chemicals. In the Diina-keli-kaumudi it is stated, "When love develops
in the heart of a devotee, he cannot check the transformation of his
sentiments. It is j ust like at the rising of the moon, when the ebb tide
of the ocean cannot be checked: immediately there must be move­
ment of high waves." Although in its natural state, the ocean is al­
ways very grave and unfathomable, when the moon rises, nothing can
check the ocean's agitation. Similarly, those who are pure devotees
cannot on any account check the movements of their feelings within.

32 I Symptoms of Continuous Ecstasy

The continuous ecstasy of love can remain like a powerful king,
subduing all temporary manifestations of love as well as any opposing
elements of anger. It can be exhibited directly or indirectly, and thus
ecstatic love can be described as direct or indirect. These symptoms
of ecstatic love are possible only when one is fully situated in a tran­
scendental position. Direct ecstatic love can be divided into two
groups-namely, selfish and selfless.
When noncontradictory symptoms· of ecstatic love are distinctly
manifest, any contradictory symptoms create a sense of abomination.
Contradictory ecstatic love is called selfish. That ecstatic love which
can adjust all contradictory or noncontradictory symptoms is called
direct selfless love. These selfless symptoms can again be divided into
five groups: neutrality, servitude, fraternity, parenthood and conjugal
love. Such ecstatic love assumes a particular mode in contact with
different objects of love.
Neutrality can be further subdivided into general, transparent and
peaceful. An attraction for Kr��a by the people in general or by chil­
dren cannot take any specific or satisfactory position. It can be mani­
fest sometimes in trembling of the body and changing of the color of
the eyes (to red, white, etc.), although there is no symptom of any
particular affection.
One old man was told by a young man: "Just see how this child­
only three years old-is so jubilant! Simply by seeing Kr��a he is run­
ning so swiftly, making a tumultuous sound. Just see!" This is an
instance of neutral ecstatic love in the heart of a child, without any

specific subdivision. Due to the different types of attraction for
279

Symptoms of Continuous Ecstasy

280

Krwa, there are different varieties of devotees. Their symptoms are
manifested transparently, just like jewels.
It is said that a great devotee briihmar-a would sometimes address
the Supreme Personality of Godhead as master, and sometimes he
would joke with the Lord, using different kinds of familiar words;
sometimes he would protect the Lord with a filial affection, and
sometimes he would cry out to the Lord, addressing Him as his be­
loved; and sometimes he would meditate on the Lord as the super­
soul. This means that the briihmar-a expressed his ecstatic loving
symptoms in different ways at different times. But in each instance,
because of ecstatic love, the briihmar-a merged himself in the ocean of
happiness and became situated in pure love. Thus he was a transparent
medium, like a jewel that shows reality in varying colors according to
its own nature.
When the great sage Narada was glorifying the pastimes of the Lord
with his vir-a, the four Kumaras, headed by Sanaka, although merged
in the impersonal conception of Brahman, were trembling all over.
Another devotee once exclaimed, "Although I can achieve liberation
simply by serving the devotees, my mind is still very much anxious to
see the Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose bodily complexion
is just like a dark cloud." When a devotee is so anxious to contact the
Supreme Personality of Godhead, that can also be accepted as a
symptom of neutral love.
Generally, a devotee of Lord Kr�pa can be placed into one of three
groups. One group consists of those who are completely dependent
on the merciful affection of the Supreme Personality of Godhead;
another group consists of devotees who are dealing with Kr�pa on
friendly terms; and the third group consists of those who are dealing
with Kr�pa as His superior, with parental affection. These three classes
of devotees gradually develop different relationships of transcenden­
tal mellow with the Personality of Godhead. When the attraction for
Krwa is based only on one particular humor, that is called kevala, or
pure state. One in this pure state of devotional service gradually de­
velops the desire to follow in the footsteps of an eternal associate of
Kr�pa, e.g., to follow in the footsteps of Rasala, the personal attendant
of Krwa in Goloka Vrndavana, or to follow Kr�pa's friends, like

281

The Nectar of Devotion

Sridama and Sudama, or to follow Nanda and Yasoda, devotees in

parenthood. Ecstatic love for Kr��a is never manifested directly with

Kr��a Himself. The devotee has to follow in the footsteps of the

eternal associates of Kr��a in Goloka Vrndavana.

When transcendental humors in relationship with Kr��a become

mixed (e.g., when the relationships with Kr��a in friendship, servitor­

ship and parental love become mixed together), the result is called

mixed humor or flavor. Such mixed transcendental flavors are mani­
fested by such devotees as Uddhava, Bhima and Mukhara, the per­

sonal attendant of Mother Y asoda. Although devotional humors are

sometimes found in mixtures, a particular humor is always fQl,!nd to

be a prominent and constant factor. That prominent humor is to be
accepted as the devotee's main relationship with Kr��a. For example,

Uddhava is in relationship with Krwa as a friend, but in Uddhava's
character a trace of servitude to Kr��a is also visible. Such friendship
is called friendship in reverence. The friendship typified by Sridama

and Sudama, however, is the standard of friendship without any tinge

of reverence.

Subordinate Ecstatic Love

The devotees who always think of Kr��a as a superior are in sub­

ordinate ecstatic love. To such a devotee the concept of inferiority to

the Lord is very prominent, and he rarely takes interest in any other

kind of transcendental loving humor with the Lord.

In the Mukunda-miilii-stotra compiled by King Kulasekhara, one

of the prayers says, "My dear Lord, You are the deliverer of living

entities from the hellish condition of materialistic life, but that does

not matter to me. Whether I am elevated to the heavenly platform or

remain on this earthly planet or am dispatched to some hellish

planet, that does not matter at all to me. My only prayer is that at

the time of my death I may simply remember Your two beautiful

feet, which are just like lotus flowers fructifying during the autumn

season."

Friendship

As far as friendship is concerned, those high-grade devotees who

Symptoms of Continuous Ecstasy

282

are almost like K:r�pa are considered to be great authorities in the

modes of friendly relations with the Supreme Personality of God­

head. On that friendly platform there are different kinds of laughing

and joking conversations. An example of such a friendly relationship

with K:r�pa is described in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam when K:r��a was

once thinking, "Today, while I was engaged in tending the cows in

the pasturing ground of V:rndavana, I went to collect some flowers in

a beautiful garden. At that time My friends, the cowherd boys, were
unhappy even to tolerate a two-minute separation from Me. And,

when they found Me, there was competition between us as to who

would touch the other first with the flowers we had in hand."

One friend criticized K:r�pa thus: "My dear Damodara, although

You have been defeated by Sridama and have become sufficiently

minimized in strength, by a false expression of strength You have

somehow covered Your shameful condition of defeat."
Parenthood, or Superiority

When Mother Yasoda heard that K:r�pa's cows were being forcibly

moved by the strong servants of Kamsa and that the tender cowherd

boys were trying to protect their cows, she began to think, "How

can I protect these poor boys from the invasion of Kamsa's ser­

vants?" This is an instance of a superior attitude in a devotee.

As soon as Mother Y asoda found her son K:r��a returning from the

pasturing ground, she immediately began to pat Him, touching her
fingers to the cheeks of the Lord.

�

33 I Conjugal Affection
"-,

Above even the humor of love between Kr��a and His parents is

the relationship of conjugal love. This is exhibited between the Lord
and the young gopis in different ways-glancing, moving the eye­

brows, speaking very sweet words, and exchanging smiles.

There is a statement in Govinda-viliisa to this effect: "Srimati

Radhara�i was looking for Kr��a very anxiously and almost dis­

appointedly." When there is such indirect expression of conjugal

love, there is smiling, astonishment, enthusiasm, lamentation, anger,
dread and sometimes ghastliness. These seven exchanges of conjugal
love form another state of ecstatic love.
In a direct relationship of conjugal love, there is laughter, astonish­
ment, chivalry, lamentation, anger and dread, but there is no ghast­
liness. These expressions are considered to be the great reservoirs of

pleasure. When these seven kinds of ecstatic loving exchanges are
manifested, they attain the status of steadiness by which the taste

of conjugal love expands.
Laughter

After He had stolen some curd from the pots of two gopis, Kr��a

told one of His gopi friends: "My dear beautiful friend, I can take
oath that I have not stolen even a drop of curd from your pot! But

still, your friend, Radhara�i, is very shamelessly smelling the flavor

I

'I

of My mouth. Kindly forbid Her from this devious policy of putting

Her face near Mine." When Kr��a was speaking like this, the friends

of Radhara�i could not check their laughter. This is an instance of

ecstasy in conjugal love.

283

Conjugal Affection

284

Astonishment
Once Brahma was watching all the cows and the cowherd boys
dressed in yellow garments and decorated with valuable j ewels. The
boys were expanding their four arms and were being worshiped by
many hundreds of other Brahmas. All the cowherd boys began to ex­

press their j oyfulness for being with Kr�l).a, the supreme Brahman. At

that time, Brahma showed his astonishment by exclaiming, "What am
I seeing here?" This is an instance of astonishment in ecstatic love.

Chivalry
On the bank of the Yamuna once there was the crackling sound of
dry leaves, giggling from the cowherd boys, and thundering from the
sky.

S ridama was tightening his belt to fight with Krwa, the con­

queror of the demon Agha. This is an instance of chivalry in ecstatic
love.

Lamentation
In

the

Tenth

Canto,

7th Chapter, 22nd

verse of Srimad­

Bhiigavatam there is a description of Kr�l).a's being taken away by the
whirlwind demon Trl).avarta. As Kr�l).a was being thus carried up into

the sky, all the gopis began to cry aloud. They approached Mother
Yasoda, stating that they could not find the son of Nanda. He had
been taken away by a whirlwind. This is an instance of lamentation in
ecstatic love.
When Krwa was fighting with Kaliya, Mother Yasoda exclaimed,
"Kr�l).a is now entrapped within the hoods of the Kaliya snake, and
yet I am not tattered to pieces! So I must admit how wonderful is
the preserving power of this material body!" This is another instance
of lamentation in ecstatic love.

Anger
When Kutila, the sister of Abhimanyu, saw Kr�l).a wearing a neck­
lace, she could understand that the j eweled ornament had been gi ven

285

The Nectar of Devotion

to Him by Radharapi. She therefore became absorbed in anger and
began to move her eyebrows, expressing her anger in ecstatic love.
Ghastliness
There is a statement by Yamunacarya to this effect: "Since I have
begun to enj oy these transcendental exchanges of love, which are
always newer and newer, whenever I remember the pleasure of past
sex life, my lips curl and I wish to spit on the idea." This is an in­
stance of ecstatic love in ghastliness.

Dread
One old devotee said, "My dear Lord, when we are away from
You we become so anxious to see You again, and there is great
misery in our lives. But then, when we do see You, there immediately
comes the fear of separation. Under the circumstances, both when
we see You and when we do not see You, we are subj ected to differ­
ent kinds of tribulation." This is an instance of a contradictory mix­
ture of ecstatic love for Kr�pa. Such ecstatic love is palatable, and
expert critics have compared such ecstatic love with a mixture of
curd, sugar candy and a little black pepper. The combined taste is
very palatable.

I

34 I The Nectar of Devotion

The particular type of ecstatic loving sentiment that develops with­
in the heart of a particular devotee is considered to be vibhiiva. And
the resultant manifestations such as moving the eyebrows, fear, as­
tonishment and smiling, which have been explained hereinbefore,
are called anubhiiva. The different causes for developing anubhiiva
and vibhiiva are called steady ecstasy, or sanciiri-bhiiva.
Whenever there is a recitation of poetry or a dramatic play on the
different pastimes of Kr��a, the audience develops different kinds of
transcendental loving service for the Lord. They enjoy different
types of vibhiiva, anubhiiva and sanciiri-bhiiva.
No one, while remaining on the material platform, should discuss
these different descriptions of bhiiva and anubhiiva by quoting dif­
ferent statements of transcendental literatures. Such manifestations
are displays of the transcendental pleasure potency of the Lord. One
should simply try to understand that on the spiritual platform, there
are many varieties of reciprocal love. Such loving exchanges should
never be considered to be material. In the Mahiibhiirata Udyama-parva
it is warned that things which are inconceivable should not be sub­
jected to arguments. Actually, the transactions of the spiritual world
are inconceivable to us in our present state of life. Great liberated
souls like Riipa Gosvami and others have tried to give us some hints
of transcendental activities in the spiritual world, but on the whole
these transactions will remain inconceivable to us at the present mo­
ment. Understanding the exchanges of transcendental loving service
with Kr��a is possible only when one is actually in touch with the
pleasure potency of the Supreme Lord.
286

287

The Nectar of Devotion

In this connection Sri Riipa Gosvami gives an example of the

clouds in the sky: the clouds in the sky arise from the ocean, and
when the clouds become water again and fall to the ground, they

glide back to the ocean. Similarly, the pleasure potency of Kr�!la is

compared with the ocean. The pure devotee is the pleasure-possessing
cloud, and when he is filled with transcendental loving service, then
he can bestow his mercy as a downpour of rain-and the pleasure
potency returns to the ocean of Kr�!J.a.

Direct and Indirect Attraction for Kruw
Transcendental pleasure derived from devotional service can be

divided into two groups: direct devotional service and indirect devo­

tional service. Direct devotional service is divided into five transcen­

dental humors or flavors, and indirect devotional service is divided

into seven transcendental humors. Direct devotional services are as
follows: neutrality, servitude, fraternity, paternity and conjugal love.

Indirect devotional service is divided into laughter, compassion, anger,

chivalry, dread, astonishment and ghastliness. Devotional service can

therefore be divided into twelve types, each of which has a different
color. The colors are white, multicolored, orange, red, light green,

grey, yellow, off-whitish, smoky, pink, black and cloudy. The twelve

different kinds of transcendental humors are controlled by different

incarnations of God, such as Kapila, Madhava, Upendra, Nrsimha,

Nandanandana, Balarama, Kiirma, Kalki, Raghava, Bhargava, Varaha

and Matsya.

Sustenance, manifestation, expansion, reflection and lamentation

are the five visible symptoms in exchanges of ecstatic love. The test
of devotional service can therefore be made in terms of these five

symptoms. In the devotional service of neutrality there is sustenance;

there is expansion in chivalrous devotional service; there is reflection

in compassionate devotional service; in angry devotional service there
is lamentation, and so on.

An apparently pitiable condition in devotional service may appear

to be distressing to the inexperienced student, but the feelings of the

devotee in this pitiable condition are considered to be ecstatic by
expert devotees. For example, the subject matter of the Riimiiyarta

The Nectar of Devotion

288

is sometimes considered to be pitiable and distressing to the heart,

but actually that is not the fact. The Riimiiyarta narrates how Lord

Rama was sent to the forest by His father j ust when He was going to

be enthroned. After Lord Rama's departure, Maharaj Dasaratha, His
father, died. In the forest His wife, Sitadevi, was kidnapped

by

Rava�a, and there was a great war. When Sitadevi was finally de­
livered from the clutches of Rava�a, Rava�a's whole family and king­
dom, and Rava�a himself, were vanquished. When Sitadevi came
home she was tried by fire, and after some days she was again ban­
ished to the forest. All of these subj ects in the Riimiiyar-a seem very
pitiable, and they may appear to be very distressing to the reciter,
but actually this is not so. Otherwise, why would Hanuman, the great
devotee of Lord Ramacandra, read daily about the activities of Lord
Ramacandra, as described in the Riimiiyar-a itself? The fact is that in

any of the above-mentioned twelve transcendental humors of devo­
tional service, everything is transcendentally pleasing.

S nla Rupa Gosvami mourns in this connection for persons who are

in the fire of false renunciation, the dry speculative habit, and who
neglect devotional service. Persons who are attached to the ritualistic

ceremonies recommended in the Vedas and to the impersonal
Brahman cannot relish the transcendental pleasure of devotional ser­
vice. S ri Rupa Gosvami advises, therefore, that devotees who have
already tasted the nectar of devotion should be very careful to protect
devotional service from such dry speculators, formal ritualistic eleva­
tionists and impersonal salvationists. Devotees should protect their
valuable j ewel of spiritual love from the clutches of thieves and bur­

glars. In other words, a pure devotee should not describe devotional
service and its different analytical aspects to dry speculators and false
renouncers.
Those who are not devotees can never achieve the benefits of devo­
tional service. For them the subj ect of devotional service is always
very difficult to understand. Only persons who have dedicated their
lives unto thP- lotus feet of the Supreme Personality of Godhead can
relish the real nectar of devotion.
When one transcends the status of ecstatic love and thus becomes
situated on the highest platform of pure goodness, one is understood
to have cleansed the heart of all material contamination. In that pure

289

The Nectar of Devotion

stage of life, one can taste this nectar, and this tasting capacity is
technically called rasa, or transcendental mood.

Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta summary study of the second division
of Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu, in the matter ofgeneral devotional service.

33'HH� �'HVd

35 I Neutral Love of God

Sri Rupa Gosvami offers his respectful prayers to the eternal Su­
preme Personality of Godhead who is always so beautiful and for
whom the pure devotees are always engaged in loving transcendental
service. This third division of Bhakti-rasiimrta-sindhu describes the
five primary kinds of devotional service-namely, neutrality, servi­
tude, fraternity, parenthood and conj ugal love. These five items will
be very elaborately explained here, and thus they have been figura­
tively described as the five waves on the western side of this ocean of
nectar of devotion.
When one is actually able to maintain the transcendental position,
his stage is called neutrality in devotional service. Some great sages
have attained this neutral position by practicing austerity, penance
and meditation to control the senses. Such sages are generally called
mystic yogis, and in most cases they are inclined to appreciate the
spiritual pleasure of the impersonal feature of the absolute truth.
They are practically unaware of the transcendental pleasure derived
from personal contact with the Supreme Godhead.
Actually the transcendental pleasure derived in association with
the Supreme Person is far greater than the pleasure derived from im­
personal Brahman realization, because of the direct meeting with the
eternal form of the Lord. lmpersonalists do not directly derive the
transcendental pleasure of association with the Lord by hearing of
His pastimes. As such, the impersonalists cannot derive any relishable
transcendental pleasure from the topics of the Bhagavad-gitii, in which
the Lord is personally talking with A rj una. The basic principle of
their impersonal attitude does not allow them the transcendental
pleasure which is relished by a devotee whose basic principle of

290

Neutral Love of God

291

understanding is the Supreme Person. The impersonalistic commen­

tary on the Bhagavad-gitii is therefore disastrous because, without

understanding the transcendental pleasure of the Gita, the imperson­

alist wants to interpret it in his own way. If an impersonalist can,
however, come in contact with a pure devotee, his transcendental
position can be changed for greater elevation. Great sages are there­
fore recommended to worship the form of the Lord in order to
achieve that highest transcendental pleasure.

Without worshiping the arca-vigraha, the form or Deity of the

Lord, one cannot understand such literature as the Bhagavad-gita and

Srimad-Bhagavatam. For those great sages situated in the position of
transcendental neutrality, the beginning should be to take shelter of
Lord Vi$pu, the four-handed eternal form of the Supreme Personality

of Godhead. The mystic yogis are therefore advised to meditate on

the form of Lord Vi$pu as recommended by Kapila Muni in the

sankhya-yoga system. Unfortunately, many mystic yogis try to medi­

tate on something void, and as is stated in the Gita, the result is that
they simply undergo trouble and do not achieve any tangible result.
When some great saintly persons who had undergone penances and
austerities saw the four-handed transcendental form of Vi$!J.U, they
began to remark as follows: "This four-handed form of the Lord,
manifested in a bluish color, is the reservoir of all pleasure and the
center of our living force. Actually, when we see this eternal form of
Vi$pu, we, along with many other paramaharhsas, become imme­

diately captivated by the beauty of the Lord." This appreciation of
Lord Vi$pU by saintly persons is an instance of situation in santa­

rasa, or the neutral stage of devotional service. In the beginning, those
who are aspiring for salvation try to get out of the material entangle­
ment by performing painful austerities and penances, and ultimately
they come to the impersonal status of spiritual realization. At this

brahma-bhiita stage of liberation from the material entanglement, the
symptoms, as explained 1n "!:he Bhagavad-gitii, are that one becomes
joyous beyond any hankering or lamentation and gains a universal
vision. When the devotee is situated in the santa-rasa, or neutral stage

of devotional service, he appreciates the Vi$I;IU form of the Lord.
Actually, all Vedic culture is aiming at understanding Lord Vi9pu.

In the !Jg Veda one mantra says that any advanced saintly person is

292

The Nectar of Devotion

always aspmng to be fixed in meditation upon the lotus feet of
Visnu.

i� the Srimad-Bhiigavatam it is said that the foolish do not know

that Vi�ttu is the ultimate goal of life. According to the conclusion of
all authoritative Vedic scriptures, when a person comes to the stage
of appreciating Viwu, he is at the beginning of devotional service.
If one cultivates devotional service further and further, under proper
guidance, other features of devotional service will gradually become
manifest. At this stage of siinta-rasa, one can see Lord Vi�tJ.U, the Su­

preme Personality of Godhead, the deliverer of even the demons. The
Lord is appreciated by such would-be devotees as the eternal tran­
scendental form, chief of all self-realized souls, the supersoul, the

supreme Brahman, completely pacified, completely controlled and
pure, merciful to the devotees and untouched by any material con­

dition. This appreciation of Lord Viwu in awe and veneration by the
saintly is to be understood as the sign that they are situated in the

siinta-rasa, or neutral stage of devotional service.

This stage of siinta-rasa can be attained by the impersonalists only

when they are in association with pure devotees. Otherwise it is not
possible. After Brahman realization, when a liberated soul comes in
contact with a pure devotee of Lord Kr�tta and submissively accepts
the teachings of Lord Kr�tta without misinterpretation, he becomes
situated in this neutral stage of devotional service. The best example
of saintly persons situated in the siinta-rasa are Sanaka, Sanatana,

Sananda, and Sanat-kumara, the Kumara brothers. These four saintly

persons (known as Catu�sana) were sons of Lord Brahma. After their
birth, when they were ordered by their father to become house­
holders and increase human society, they refused the order. They said
that they had already decided not to become entangled with family
life; they would rather live as saintly brahmaciiris for their own perfec­

tion. So these great saints have been living for millions of years now,
but still they appear to be just like boys of four or five years. Their
complexions are very fair, there is an effulgence in their bodies, and
they always travel naked. These four saintly persons almost always
remain together.
In one of the prayers of the Kumara brothers, the declaration is
made: "My Lord Mukunda [Kr�tJ.a, the giver of liberation], only so

Neutral Love of God

293

long as one does not happen to see Your eternal form of bliss and
knowledge, appearing just like a newly-grown tiimala tree, with a
bluish hue-only for so long can the impersonal feature of the abso­
lute truth, known as Brahman, be very pleasing to a saintly person."
The qualifications of a saintly person are described in the Bhakti­
rasamrta-sindhu as follows: A saintly person is one who understands

fully that simply by dischar gi ng devotional service he can become
confident of liberation. He is always situated in the regulative princi­

ples of devotional life and at the same time aspires to be liberated
from the material entanglement.
A saintly person thinks like this: "When shall I be able to live alone
in the caves of the mountains? When shall I be dressed simply with
undergarments? When shall I be satisfied by eating simply a little
fruit and vegetables? When will it be possible for me to always think
of the lotus feet of Mukunda, who is the source of the Brahman ef­
fulgence? When, in such a spiritual condition of life, shall I fully
understand my days and nights to be insignificant moments in eternal
time?"
The devotees and self-realized persons who are engaged in preach­
ing the glories of the Lord always maintain an ecstatic love for the
Lord within their hearts. Thus they are benefitted by the rays of the
ecstatic moon, and they are called saintly persons.
The impulse of a saintly person is to be engaged in the study of the
Vedas, especially the Upani�adic portions, to always live in a place
where there is no disturbance from the common people, to always
think of the eternal form of Kr��a, to be ready to consider and
understand the absolute truth, to always be prominent in exhib­
iting knowledge, to see the Supreme Lord in His universal form
(viSva-riipa), to associate always with learned devotees and to dis­
cuss the conclusion of the Vedas with similarly elevated persons. All
of these qualifications of a saintly person serve to raise him to the
status of santa-rasa.
In the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu it is stated that all those who at­
tended the pious meeting held by Lord Brahma for the study of
Vedic literature like the Upani§ads became overwhelmed with ec­
static love for Kr��a, the chief of the Yadu dynasty. Actually, the re­
sult of studying the Upani§ads is to understand the Supreme Per-

294

The Nectar of Devotion

sonality of Godhead. Negation of material existence is only one of
the subjects of the Upani§ads. The next subject concerns becoming

situated in the impersonal realization. And then, after penetrating

through the impersonal Brahman, when one comes to the platform
of associating with the Supreme Personality of Godhead, one reaches
the ultimate goal in studying the Upani§ads.

Those who are situated on the platform of siinta-rasa get their im­

petus for advancement in devotional service by smelling the tulasi of­

fered at the lotus feet of the Lord, by hearing the sound of His
conchshell, by seeing a sanctified place in some mountain or hill, by
observing a forest like the ones in V rndavana, by going to a place of
pilgrimage, by visiting the course of the Ganges River, by being vic­
torious over the dictations of bodily demands (i.e., eating, sleeping,
mating and defending), by understanding the devastation of eternal
time, and by constantly associating with devotees engaged in Kr�!la
consciousness. All these different items are favorable in elevating
saintly persons situated in siinta-rasa to the advanced stage of devo­
tional service.

In the Third Canto, 15th Chapter, 43rd verse of Srimad-Bhiigavatam

there is a statement by the four saintly persons known as Catu�sana,

headed by Sanaka-kumara. They went to visit the Lord of V aikuptha­
loka in the spiritual sky, and when they bowed down before the
Lord, the aroma of the tulasi, mixed with saffron, entered their nos­

trils and immediately attracted their minds. Although these four
saintly persons were always absorbed in the thought of impersonal

Brahman, from association with the Lord and from smelling the

tulasi leaves, the hairs on their bodies immediately stood up. This
shows that even a person who is situated in Brahman realization, if
he is put into association with devotees in pure devotional service,
will immediately become attracted to the personal feature of the
Lord.

There are certain symptoms of great sages who are situated in

I

lj

siinta-rasa devotional service, and these symptoms are exhibited as

follows: they concentrate their eyesight on the tip of the nose, and

they behave just like an avadhiita. Avadhiita means a highly elevated
mystic who does not c�.re for any social, religious or Vedic conven-

Neutral Love of God

295

tions. Another symptom is that such persons are very careful to step
forward when giving speeches. When they speak, they join together
the forefinger and thumb. (This is called the jiiana-mudra position.)
They are not against the atheists, nor are they particularly inclined
to the devotees. Such persons give stress to liberation and detachment
from the materialistic way of life. They are always neutral and have
no affection for nor misidentification with anything material. They are
always grave, but fully absorbed in thoughts of the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead. These uncommon features develop in devotees who
are situated in santa-rasa.
Regarding concentration of the eyesight on the tip of the nose,

there is a statement in the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu by a devotee who
observed this being performed by a yogi. He remarked, "This great
sage is concentrating his eyesight on the tip of his nose, and from this
it appears that he has already realized the eternal form of the Lord
within himself."
Sometimes a devotee in santa-rasa yawns, stretches his limbs, in­
structs on devotional service, offers respectful obeisances unto the
form of the Lord, offers nice prayers to the Lord and has a desire to
give direct service with his body. These are some of the common
symptoms of the devotee who is situated in neutrality. One devotee,
after observing the yawning of another devotee, addressed him thus:
"My dear mystic, I think that within your heart there is some ec­
static devotional love which is causing you to yawn." It is sometimes
found that a devotee in the santa-rasa falls down on the ground, his
hairs stand up on his body, and he trembles all over. In this way, dif­
ferent symptoms of ecstatic trance are exhibited automatically by
such devotees.

In the Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu it is said that when Lord Krsna was
.

.

.

.

blowing His conchshell known as Paficajanya many great sages who
were living in the caves of the mountains immediately reacted, being
awakened from their trance of meditation. They immediately saw
that the hairs of their bodies were standing. Sometimes devotees in
santa-rasa become stunned, peaceful, jubilant, deliberate, reflective,

anxious, dexterous and argumentative. These symptoms indicate con­
tinuous ecstasy, or established emotion.

296

The Nectar of Devotion

Once a great realized sage was lamenting that the Supreme Lord
Kr�!la was living in Dvaraka but that he was unable to take advantage
of seeing Him. After thinking thi�, the sage immediate! y became
stunned. He was thinking that he was simply wasting his time. In
other words, the sage lamented because the Supreme Personality of
Godhead was personally present, and he still could not take advan­
tage of this because of his meditation.
When a mystic is transcendental to all kinds of mental concoctions
and is situated in Brahman, his state is called trance beyond the in­
fluence of the material conception of life. In that stage, when one
hears about the transcendental pastimes of the Lord, there may be
shivering in the body.
When a Brahman-realized devotee who has come to the stage of
steady trance comes into contact with the eternal form of Kr�!J.a, his
transcendental pleasure increases millions of times. One great sage
once inquired from another, "My dear friend, do you think that after
I perfect the eightfold yoga performance I shall be able to see the
eternal form of the Supreme Personality of Godhead?" This enquiry
from the sage is an instance of inquisitiveness in a devotee situated in
the neutral stage of devotional service.
When Lord Kr�!J.a, along with His elder brother Balarama and sister
Subhadra, came to Kuruk�etra in a chariot on the occasion of a solar
eclipse, many mystic yogis also came. When these mystic yogis saw
Lord Kr�!la and Balarama, they exclaimed that now that they had
seen the excellent bodily effulgence of the Lord, they had almost
forgotten the pleasure derived from impersonal Brahman realization.
In this connection one of the mystics approached Krwa and said,
"My dear Lord, You are always full with transcendental bliss, ex­
celling all other spiritual positions. And so, simply by seeing You
from a distant place, I have come to the conclusion that there is no
need of my being situated in the transcendental bliss of impersonal
Brahman."
When a great mystic was once awaken�d from his meditative
trance by hearing the vibration of Kn;!la 's Paiicaj anya conchshell, the
mystic became overpowered. So much so, in fact, that he began to
bash his head on the ground, and with eyes full of tears of ecstatic

Neutral Love of God

297

love, he violated all the rules and regulations of his yoga perform­
ances. Thus he at once neglected the process of Brahman realization.

Bilvamaitgala Thakur, in his book Kr§!w-karrul.mrta, says, "Let the

impersonalists be engaged in the process of transcendental realization

by worshiping the impersonal Brahman. Although I was also initiated

into that path of Brahman realization, I have now become misled by

a naughty boy-one who is very cunning, who is very much attached
to the gopis and who has made me His maidservant. So I have now
forgotten the process of Brahman realization."

Bilvamaitgala Thakur was first spiritually initiated for impersonal

realization of the absolute truth, but later on, by his association
with Kr��a in Vrndavana, he became an experienced devotee. The

same thing happened to Sukadeva Gosvam'i, who also reformed him­
self by the grace of the Lord and took to the path of devotional ser­

vice, giving up the way of impersonal realization.
Sukadeva Gosvam'i and Bilvamaitgala Thakur's giving up of the im­

personal conception of the absolute truth and taking to devotional
service are the best examples of devotees being situated in the neutral
state. According to some authorities, this condition cannot be ac­

cepted as one of the transcendental humors, or rasas, but Srila Riipa

Gosvam'i says that even if one does not accept it as a transcendental
humor, one must still accept it as the beginning position of devo­

tional service. However, if one is not further raised to the platform of
actual service to the Lord, he is not considered to be on the platform

of transcendental mellow. In this connection, in the Eleventh Canto

of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, Lord Kr��a personally instructs Uddhava like

this: "The state of being established in My personal form is called

siinta-rasa, and without being situated in this position, no one can ad­

vance to actual pure devotional service." In other words, no one can

be situated in the personal feature of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead without being situated at least in santa-rasa.

36 I Transcendental Affection

(Servitude)

The transcendental mellow of affection has been accepted by au­

thorities like Sridhara Svami as a perfectional stage of devotion. It is

just above the humor of neutrality and is a requisite for the develop­

ment of the serving humor. In literature such as Niima-kaumudi this
state of existence is accepted as continual affection for or attraction

to Krwa. Authorities like Sukadeva consider this stage of affection
to be in the neutral stage, but in any case this affection is relished by

the devotees in different transcendental tastes, and therefore the
general name for this state is affection, or pure affection for Kr�tJ.a.

Devotees engaged in servitude are attached to K.rwa in the af­

fection of reverence. Some of the inhabitants of Gokula (Vrndavana
as exhibited on earth) are attached to Kr�tta on this platform of af­

fection in reverence. The inhabitants of Vrndavana used to say,

"Kr�tta is always manifest before us with a complexion like a blackish

:I

cloud. He holds His wonderful flute in His lotus hands. He is dressed
in yellow silks and bedecked with a peacock feather on His head.

When Kr�tta walks near Govardhan Hill with these personal features,

all the inhabitants of the heavenly planets, as well as the inhabitants
of this earth, feel transcendental bliss and consider themselves the
eternal servants of the Lord." Sometimes the devotee becomes filled

with the same awe and reverence by seeing a picture of Vi�tJ.U, who is
dressed like Kr�tta and who has a similar complexion. The only dif­

ference is that Vi�ttu has four hands, in which He holds the conch­

shell, the disc, the club and the lotus flower. Lord Vi�ttu is always

decorated with many valuable jewels, such as the candrakiinta stone

and the suryakiinta stone.

298

Transcendental Affection (Servitude)

299

In the Lalita-miidhava by Rupa Gosvam'i there is the following

statement by Daruka, one of the servants of Kr�tta: "Certainly Lord

Vi�ttu is very beautiful with His necklace of kaustubha jewels, His
four hands holding conchshell, disc, club and lotus flower and His
dazzlingly beautiful jewelry. He is also very beautiful in His eternal
position, riding upon the shoulder of Garu9a. But now the same Lord

Vi�ttu is present as the enemy of Kamsa, and by His personal feature

I am completely forgetting the opulence of Vaikutttha."
Another devotee once said, "This Supreme Personality of Godhead

from whose bodily pores come millions of universes, permanently
rising, who is the ocean of mercy, who is the owner of inconceivable

energies, who is always equipped with all perfections, who is the

origin of all incarnations, who is the attraction for all liberated per­

sons-this very Supreme Personality of Godhead is the supreme con­
troller, the supremely worshipable, all-cognizant, fully determined,

fully opulent, the emblem of forgiveness, the protector of surren­

dered souls, munificent, true to His promise, expert, all-auspicious,

powerful, religious, a strict follower of the scripture, the friend of

the devotees, magnanimous, influential, grateful, reputable, respect­

able, full of all strength and submissive to pure love. Surely He is the
only shelter of devoteec who are attracted to Him by the affection of

servitorship."

The devotees of the Lord in servitude are divided into four classes:
appointed servants (such as Lord Brahma and Lord Siva, who are ap­
pointed to control over the material modes of passion and ignorance),

devotees in servitude who are protected by the Lord, devotees who

are always associates, and devotees who are simply following in the

footsteps of the Lord.

In a conversation between ]ambavat'i, one of Krwa 's wives, and

Kalind'i, her friend, Jambavat'i enquired, "Who is this personality
circumambulating our Kr9tta ?"

Kalind'i replied, "He is Ambikeya, the superintendent of all universal

affairs."

Then Jambavat'i enquired, "Who is this personality who is trem­

bling at the sight of Kr�tta?"

300

The Nectar of Devotion

Kalind'i replied, "He is Lord Siva."
Then Jambavafi enquired, "Who is the person offering prayers?"
Kalind'i replied, "He is Lord Brahma."
Jambavat'i then asked, "Who is that person who has fallen on the

ground and is offering respect to Kr�l).a?"

Kalindl replied, "He is Indra, the King of heaven."

Jambavat'i next inquired, "Who is this person who has come with

the demigods and is laughing with them?"

Kalind'i replied, "He is my elder brother, Yamaraja, the superin­

tendent of death."

This conversation offers a description of all the demigods, in­

cluding Yamaraja, who are engaged in services appointed by the
Lord. They are called adhikrta-devatii, or demigods appointed to par­

ticular types of departmental service.

One resident of Vrndavana once told Lord Kr�l).a, "My dear Kr�l).a,

0 pleasure of Vrndavana! Being afraid of this material existence, we

have taken shelter of You, for You can completely protect us! We

are well aware of Your greatness. As such, we have given up our de­

sire for liberation and have taken complete shelter under Your lotus
feet. Since we have heard about Your ever-increasing transcendental
love, we have voluntarily engaged ourselves in Your transcendental
service." This statement is by a devotee who is under the protection
and shelter of Lord Kr�l).a.

Upon being chastised by Kr�l).a's constant kicking on his head,

Kaliya, the black snake of the Yamuna, came to his senses- and ad­

mitted, "My dear Lord, I have been so offensive unto You, but still
You are so kind that You have marked my head with the impression

of Your lotus feet." This also is an instance of one's taking shelter

under the lotus feet of Krwa.

In the Apariidha-bhaiijana a pure devotee expresses his feelings:

"My dear Lord, I am ashamed to admit before You that I have car­

ried out the orders of my masters named lust, anger, avarice, illusion

and envy. Sometimes I have carried out their orders in a way most

abominable. Yet in spite of my serving them so faithfully, they are
neither satisfied nor are they kind enough to give me relief from their

service. They are not even ashamed of taking service from me in that

Transcendental Affection (Servitude)

301

way. My dear Lord, 0 head of the Yadu dynasty, now I have come
to my senses, and I am taking shelter of Your lotus feet. Please en­
gage me in Your service." This is another instance of surrendering
and taking shelter of the lotus feet of Kr9ra.

There are many instances in the various Vedic writings of persons

who were aspiring after liberation by speculative knowledge but gave
up this process in order to take complete shelter under the lotus feet

of Krwa. Examples of such persons are the briihmar-as headed by
Saunaka in the forest of N aimi9ararya. * Learned scholars accept

them as devotees having complete wisdom. There is a statement in
the Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya in which these great briihmar-as and sages,
headed by Saunaka �9i, told Suta Gosvami: "1\)y dear great soul, just
see how wonderful it is! Although as human beings we are contami­
nated with so many taints of material existence, simply by our con­
versing with you about the Supreme Personality of Godhead we are

now gradually decrying our desire for liberation."

In Padyiivali a devotee says, "Persons who are attached to specula­

tive knowledge for self realization, who have decided that the su­

preme truth is beyond meditation and who have thus become situated

in the modes of goodness-let them peacefully execute their engage­

ment. As for us, we are simply attached to the Supreme Personality

of Godhead, who is by nature so pleasing, who possesses a com­

plexion like a blackish cloud, who is dressed in yellow garments and

who has beautiful lotus-like eyes. We wish only to meditate upon
H.Im."

Those who are from the very beginning of their self realization at­

tached to devotional service are called seviini§tha. Seviini§tha means
simply attached to devotional service. The best examples of such devo­
tees

are

Lord Siva, King Indra, King Bahulasva, King Ik�vaku,

Srutadeva and Pur9.arika. One devotee says: "My dear Lord, Your
transcendental qualities attract even the liberated souls and carry
them to the assembly of devotees where Your glories are constantly
chanted. Even great sages who are accustomed to live in solitary

*

These a.re the

briihmar:as to whom Srimad-Bhiigavatam was spoken by Suta

Gosvami, as described in the author's Srimad-Bhiigavatam, Volume I, Chapter l.

302

The Nectar of Devotion

places are also attracted by the songs of Your glory. And, observing

all Your transcendental qualities, I have also become attracted and
have decided to dedicate my life to Your loving service."

In the city of Dvaraka the following devotees are known as Kn;�a's

close

associates:

Uddhava,

Daruka,

Satyaki,

Srutadeva,

Satrajit,

Nanda, Upananda and Bhadra. All of these personalities remain with

the Lord as His secretaries, but still they are sometimes engaged in
His personal service. Among the Kuru dynasty, Bhi�ma, Maharaj

Parik�it and Vidura are also known as close associates of Lord Krwa.

It is said, "All the associates of Lord Krwa have lustrous bodily fea­

tures, and their eyes are just like lotus flowers. They have sufficient
power to defeat the strength of the demigods, and the specific fea­

ture of their persons is that they are always decorated with valuable
ornaments."

When Kr��a was in the capital of Indraprastha, someone addressed

Him thus:

"My dear Lord, Your personal associates, headed by

Uddhava, are always awaiting Your order by standing at the entrance

gate of Dvaraka. They are mostly looking on with tears in their eyes,

and in the enthusiasm of their service they are not afraid even of the
devastating fire generated by Lord Siva. They are souls simply sur­

rendered unto Your lotus feet."

Out of the many close associates of Lord Krwa, Uddhava is con­

sidered the best. The following is a description of him: "His body is
blackish like the color of the Yamuna River, and it is similarly as

cool. He is always decorated with flower garlands first used by Lord

Kr��a, and he is dressed with yellow silk clothing. His two arms are

just like the bolts of a door, His eyes are just like lotus flowers, and
he is the most important devotee amongst all the associates. Let us

therefore offer our respectful obeisances unto Uddhava's lotus feet."

Uddhava has described the transcendental qualities of Sri Kr�lla as

follows: "Lord Sri Kr��a, who is our master and worshipable Deity,

who is the controller of Lord Siva and Lord Brahma, the controller

of the whole universe as well, accepts the controlling orders of
Ugrasena, His grandfather. He is the proprietor of millions of uni­

verses, but still He begged a little land from the ocean. And although

He is just like an ocean of wisdom, still He sometimes consults me.

Transcendental Affection (Servitude)

303

He is so great and magnanimous, yet He is engaged in His different

activities just like an ordinary person."

Those who are constantly engaged in the personal service of the

Lord are called anugas, or followers. Examples of such followers are

Sucandra, Ma��ana, Stamba and Sutamba. They are all inhabitants

of the city of Dvaraka, and they are dressed and ornamented like the
other associates. The specific services entrusted to the anugas are

varied. Ma��ana always bears the umbrella over the head of Lord
Krwa. Sucandra is engaged in fanning the white ciimara bunch of

hair, and Sutamba is engaged in supplying betel nuts. All of them

are great devotees, and they are always busy in the transcendental
loving service of the Lord.

As there are anugas in Dvaraka, so there are many anugas in Vrn­

davana also. The names of the anugas in Vrndavana are as follows:

Raktaka, Patraka, Patr'i, Madhuka�tha, Madhuvrata, Rasala, Suvilasa,
Premakanda,

Marandaka,

Rasada, and Sarada.

Ananda,

Candrahasa,

Payoda,

Bakula,

Descriptions of the bodily features of the anugas in Vrndavana

are given in the following statement: "Let us offer our respectful
obeisances unto the constant associates of the son of Maharaj Nanda.

They always stay in Vrndavana, and their bodies are decorated with

garlands of pearls and with bangles and bracelets of gold. Their colors
are like black bees and the golden moon, and they are dressed just to

suit their particular special bodily features. Their specific duties can be
understood from a statement by Mother Y a8oda, who said, 'Bakula,

please cleanse the yellowish dress of Kr9�a. Varida, you just flavor

the bathing water with aguru scent. And Rasala, you just prepare the

betel nuts. You can all see that Krwa is approaching. There is dust
overhead, and the cows can be seen very distinctly."'

Amongst all the anugas, Raktaka is considered to be the chief. The
description of his bodily features is as follows: "He wears yellow
clothing, and his bodily color is just like newly-grown grass. He is

very expert in singing and is always engaged in the service of the son

of Maharaj Nanda. Let us all become the followers of Raktaka in

offering transcendental loving service to Kr��a!" An example of the
attachment felt by Raktaka toward Lord Kr��a can be understood

304

The Nectar of Devotion

from his statement to Rasada: "Just hear me! Please place me so that

I may always be engaged in the service of Lord Kr�pa, who has now

become famous as the lifter of the Govardhan Hill."

The devotees of Kr�pa engaged in His personal service are always

very cautious because they know that becoming personal servitors of

Lord Kr�pa is not an ordinary thing. A person who offers respect

even to the ants engaged in the service of the Lord becomes eternally

happy, so what is there to say of one who offers Kr�pa direct service?

Raktaka once said within himself, "Not only is Kr�pa my worshipable

and servable Lord, but also the girl friends of Kr�pa, the gopis, are
equally worshipable and servable by me. And not only the gopis, but

anyone who is engaged in the service for the Lord is also worshipable

and servable by me. I know that I must be very careful not to become

overly proud that I am one of the servitors and devotees of the

Lord." From this statement one can understand that the pure devo­
tees, those who are actually engaged in the service of the Lord, are
always very cautious and are never overly proud of their service.

This mentality of the direct servitor of Kr�pa is called dhurya

.

According to expert analytical studies of the direct associates of the
Lord, Srila Riipa Gosvami has divided these into three classes-name­

ly, dhurya, dhira and vira. Raktaka is classified among the dhurya, or
those who are always attached to serve the most beloved gopis.
One dhira associate of Krwa is the son of Satyabhama's nurse.

Satyabhama is one of the queens of Lord Kr�pa in Dvaraka, and

when she was married to Kr�pa, the son of her nurse was allowed to
go with her because they had lived together from childhood as broth­

er and sister. So this gentleman, the son of Satyabhama's nurse, used

to live with Kr�pa as His brother-in-law, and sometimes as brother-in­

law he used to play jokes with Kr�pa. He once addressed Kr�pa in this

way: "My dear Kr�pa, I never tried to gain the favor of the goddess
of fortune, who is married to You, but still I am so fortunate that I

am considered one of the members of Your house, the brother of
Satyabhama."

This same person once expressed his pride, declaring, "Lord Bala­

deva may be a great enemy of Pralambasura, but I have nothing to
worry about from Him. And as far as Pradyumna is concerned, I have

Transcendental Affection (Servitude)

305

nothing to take from him, because he is simply a boy. Therefore I do
not expect anything from anyone else. I simply expect the favorable

glance of Kr��a upon me, and so I am not even afraid of Satyabhama,
who is so dear to Krsna."

In the Fourth c"� �to of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, 20th Chapter, 25th

verse, King Prthu addresses the Lord, saying, "My dear Lord, it may
happen that the goddess of fortune becomes dissatisfied with my

work, or I may even have some misunderstanding with her, but I will

not mind this because I have full confidence in You. You are always
causelessly merciful to Your servants, and You consider even their
menial service to be very much advanced. So I have confidence that
You will accept my humble service, although it is not worthy of
being recognized. My dear Lord, You are self-sufficient. You can do
anything You like without the help of anyone else. So even if the
goddess of fortune is not satisfied with me, I know You will always
accept my service anyway."
Devotees attached to the trar.tscendental loving service of the Lord
may be described either as surrendered souls, as souls advanced in
devotional knowledge, or as souls completely engaged in the tran­

scendental loving service. Such devotees are called, respectively,
neophyte, perfect and eternally perfect.

,,

37 I Impetuses for Kr��a's Service

I
I
The causeless mercy of Krwa, the dust of His lotus feet, His
prasadam and association with His devotees are some impetuses to­
ward a devotee's engagement in transcendental loving service to the
,
Lord.
Kn;�a exhibited His causeless mercy when He was present at the
departure of Grandfather Bhi�ma. During the Battle of Kuruk�etra,
Bhi�madeva, the grandfather of Arjuna, was lying on a bed of arrows
before departing from this mortal world. When Lord Kr�!la, Maharaj
Yudhi�thira and the other Pa!l-9-avas approached Bhi�madeva, he was
very grateful to Lord Kr�!la, and he addressed the briihmar-a military
commander, Krpacarya, thus: "My dear Krpacarya, just see the won­
derful causeless mercy of Lord Kr�!la! I am most unfortunate. I have
no qualifications. I was opposing Kr�!la's most intimate friend,
Arjuna-I even tried to kill him! I have so many disqualifications, and
yet the Lord is still so kind that He has come to see me at the last
point of my life. He is worshipable by all great sages, but still He is
so merciful that He has come to see an abominable person like me."
Sometimes the vibration of Lord Krwa's flute, His bugling, His
smiling, His footmarks on the ground, the transcendental fragrance
of His body and the appearance of a new cloud in the sky also be­
come impetuses for ecstatic love of Him.
In the Vidagdha-miidhava there is the following statement: "When
Kr�!la was playing on His flute, Baladeva very anxiously declared,
'Just see how, after hearing the transcendental sound of Kr�!la's

'I
II"'
'I

flute, Indra the King of heaven is crying in his heavenly kingdom!

And from his teardrops falling on the ground, Vrndavana appears to
have become a celestial residence for the demigods."'

Ecstatic love for Kr?�a, which is known as anubhava, is symp­

tomized by the following signs: one becomes engaged exclusively in
the service of the Lord, being attentive to carry out the orders of the
Lord faithfully; one becomes undisturbed and non-envious in full
transcendental loving service to the Lord; and one makes friendship
with the devotees of the Lord who are situated in faithful service to
Him. All of these symptoms are called anubhava, ecstatic love.

The first symptom of anubhava, or engagement in a particular type

of service, is exemplified by Daruka, a servant of Kr?�a who used to
fan Kr?�a with a camara, a bunch of hair. When he was engaged in
such service, he was filled with ecstatic love, and the symptoms of
ecstatic love became manifest in his body. But Daruka was so serious
about his service that he checked all of these manifestations of ec­
static love and considered them hindrances to his engagement. He did
not care very much for these manifestations, although they auto­
matically developed.

In the Srimad-Bhagavatam, Tenth Canto, 86th Chapter, 27th verse,

there is a statement of how S rutadeva, a brahmarza from the country
called Mithila in northern India, would become so overpowered with

j oy as soon as he saw Kr��a that immediately after bowing to the
Lord's lotus feet, he would stand up and begin to dance, raising his
two arms above his head.
One of the devotees of Lord Kr?�a once addressed Him in this
manner: "My dear Lord, although You are not a professional dancer,
by Your dancing You have so astonished us that we can understand
that You are personally the master of all dancing. Certainly You must
have learned this dancing art directly from the goddess of love."
When a devotee dances in ecstatic love, there are manifestations of
symptoms which are called sattvika. Sattvika means that they are

from the transcendental platform. They are not symptoms of material
emotions; they come from the soul proper.

In the Srimad-Bhagavatam, Tenth Canto, 85th Chapter, 30th verse,

S ukadeva Gosvaml tells Maharaj Parlk�it that after surrendering every­
thing unto the lotus feet of Vamanadeva, Bali Maharaj immediately

308

The Nectar of Devotion

caught hold of the lotus feet of the Lord and pressed them to his

heart. Being overwhelmed with j oy, he manifested all the symptoms
of ecstatic love, with tears in his eyes and a faltering voice.
In such expressions of ecstatic love there are many other subsidiary

symptoms, such as j ubilation, withering, silence, disappointment,
moroseness, reverence, thoughtfulness, remembrance, doubtfulness,

confidence, eagerness, indifference, restlessness, impudence, shyness,
inertness, illusion, madness, ghastliness, contemplation, dreaming,
disease and signs of death. When a devotee meets Kn;!la, there are

symptoms of j ubilation, pride and perseverence, and when he is feel­

ing great separation from Kr9!la, the symptoms of ghastliness, disease
and the signs of death become prominent.
It is stated in the First Canto of the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, 11th
Chapter, 4th verse, that when Lord Krwa returned from the battle­
field of Kuruk9etra to His home at Dvaraka, all the residents of
Dvaraka began to talk with Him, as a child talks lovingly to his father
after the father's return from foreign countries. This is an example of

j ubilation.
When Bahulasva, the King of Mithila, saw Kr9!la at his palace, he
decided to offer his respects by bowing down before Him at least a
hundred times, but he was so overcome by feelings of love that, after
bowing down only once, he forgot his position and could not rise up
agam.
In the Skanda Puriir:w a devotee tells Lord Kr9!la: "My dear Lord,
as the sun evaporates all the water on the ground by its scorching
heat, so my mental state has dried away the luster of my face and
body, due to separation from You." This is an example of withering
in ecstatic love.
An expression of disappointment was made by Indra, the King of
heaven. When he saw the sungod, he told him, "My dear sungod, your
sunshine is very glorious because it reaches unto the lotus feet of
Lord Krwa, the master of the Yadu dynasty. I have thousands of
eyes, but they have proved to be useless because not even for a
moment are they able to see the lotus feet of the Lord."
Reverential devotion for the Lord gradually increases and trans­
forms itself into ecstatic love, then affection and then attachment.

Impetuses for K[§[W 's Seroice

309

In the Tenth Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, 38th Chapter, 5th verse,
Akrura says: "Because I am going to see Lord Kn;�a today, all symp­

toms of inauspiciousness have already been killed. My life is now suc­

cessful because I shall be able to offer my respects unto the lotus feet

of the Supreme Personality of Godhead!"

Another devotee in ecstatic reverential affection once said, "When

will that glorious day in my life come when it will be possible for me

to go to the bank of the Yamuna and see Lord Sri Krwa playing

there as cowherd boy?"

When there is no diminishing of this ecstatic love and when it is

freed from all kinds of doubt, that stage is called steady love for
Krwa. In this stage all expressions of unhappiness by the devotee are

called anubhiiva, or ecstatic loving symptoms.

The symptom of ecstatic affection with reverence felt by Bali

Maharaj is expressed as follows: "My dear Lord, You have simultane·
ously punished me and showed me Your causeless mercy. My conclu­
sion is that when I have taken shelter of Your lotus feet I shall never
be disturbed in any condition of life. Whether You give me the op­

portunity to enjoy all the yogic perfections, or You put me into the
most abominable condition of hellish life, I shall never be disturbed."
Kr��a, Himself, after seeing Bali Maharaj, told Uddhava, "My dear

friend, how can I express the glorious characteristics of Bali Maharaj,
the son of Virocana? Although the king of the suras [demigods] was
cursed by this son of Virocana, and although I cheated him in my
incarnation as Vamana, taking away his dominions throughout the
universe, and although I still criticized him for not fulfilling his prom·
ise, I have just now seen him in his kingdom, and he feelingly ex­

pressed his love for me."*

When such a feeling of love becomes intensified, it is called affec-

I
*

Bali was a king of the demons who waged war against the demigods and nearly

conquered the universe. When the demigods prayed for help, the Lord appeared

as Vamanadeva, a dwarf briihmar;w, and asked Bali for three paces of land. Bali

agreed, and Vamana covered all the worlds with His first two steps. Then He
·

demanded to know where His third pace was to be. Bali offered his own head
beneath the Lord's foot and thus became a mahiijana, or great devotee.

310

The Nectar of Devotion

tion. In that affectional stage no one can bear separation from Krwa
even for a moment.
One devotee told Daruka, the servant of Kr�!J.a: "My dear Daruka,
when you become like wood because of your separation from Kr�!J.a,

it is not so wonderful. Whenever any devotee sees Kr�!J.a, his eyes be­
come filled with water, and in separation any devotee like you would
become stunned, standing j ust like a wooden doll. That is not a very

wonderful thing."
There is a statement about Uddhava's symptoms of love. When he
saw Lord Kr�!la his eyes filled with tears and created a river which
flowed down toward the sea of Kr�!la to offer tribute, as a wife offers
tribute to her husband. When his body erupted with goose-pimples,

he appeared like the kadamba flower, and when he began to offer
prayers, he appeared completely distinct from all other devotees.
When affection is symptomized by direct happiness and distress,
that is called attraction. In such an attracted state of ecstatic love,
one can face all kinds of disadvantages calmly. Even at the risk of
death such a devotee is never bereft of the transcendental loving ser­
vice of the Lord. A glorious example of this ecstatic love was exhibited
by King Parik�it when he was at the point of death. Although he was

'"

bereft of his entire kingdom, which spread over all the world, and
although he was accepting not even a drop of water in the seven
days remaining to him, because he was engaged in hearing the tran­

scendental pastimes of the Lord from S ukadeva Gosvami, he was not
in the least distressed. On the contrary, he was feeling direct tran­

scendental ecstatic j oy in association with S ukadeva Gosvami

One devotee has confidently expressed this opinion: "If a drop of
Lord Kr�!la's mercy can be bestowed upon me, then I shall feel com­
pletely carefree, even in the midst of a fire or an ocean. But if I be­
come bereft of His causeless mercy, then even if I became the King

of Dvaraka, I would be simply an obj ect for pinpricks."

Devotees such as Maharaj Parik�it and Uddhava are all situated in

ecstatic attraction on the basis of affection, and in that state of af­
fection a feeling of friendship becomes manifest. When Uddhava was
i.

freed from all material contamination, he saw the Lord, and his
throat became choked up, and he could not speak. By the movements

Impetuses for KrHw's Service

311

of his eyebrows alone he was embracing the Lord. Such ecstatic love
has been divided by great scholars into two groups-addition and sub­
traction. If a devotee is not directly associated with the Lord, it is
called subtraction. In this state of love, one is constantly fixed with
his mind at the lotus feet of the Lord. A devotee in this state be­
comes very eager to learn of the transcendental qualities of the Lord.
The most important business of such a devotee is attaining the asso­
ciation of the Lord.
In the Nrsimha Puriirta there is a statement about King Ik�vaku
which illustrates this state of ecstatic love. Because of his great affec­
tion for Kr�pa, King Ik�vaku became greatly attached to the black
cloud, the black deer, the deer's black eyes and to the lotus flower,
which is always compared to the eyes of the Lord. In the Tenth
Canto, 38th Chapter, 9th verse of the Bhiigavatam, Akrura thinks:
"Since the Lord has now appeared to diminish the great burden of
the world and is now visible to everyone's eyes in His personal tran­
scendental body, when we see Him before us, is that not the ultimate
perfection of our eyes?" In other words, Akrura realized that the
perfection of the eyes is fulfilled when one is able to see Lord Kr�pa.
Therefore, when Lord Kr�pa was visible on the earth by direct appear­
ance, everyone who saw Him surely attained perfection of sight.
In the K[§rta-karrtiimrta written by Bilvamangala Thakur there is
this expression of eagerness in ecstatic love: "How miserable it is, my
dear Kr�pa, 0 friend of the hopeless! 0 merciful Lord, how can I
pass these thankless days without seeing You?" A similar sentiment
was expressed by Uddhava when he wrote a letter to Kr�pa and said,
"My dear Supreme King of Braj a, You are the vision of nectar for
the eyes, and without seeing Your lotus feet and the effulgence of
Your body, my mind is always morose. I cannot perceive any peace
under any circumstance. Besides that, I am feeling every moment's
separation to be like the duration of many, many long years."
In the K[§rta-karrtiimrta it is also said, "My dear Lord, You are the
ocean of mercy. With my arms placed upon my head, I am bowing
down befor.

You with all humility and sincerity. I am praying unto

You, my Lord. Would You be pleased j ust to sprinkle a little of the
water of Your glance upon me? That will be a great satisfaction."

312

The Nectar of Devotion

A devotee of Lord Kr�tta said, "When even Sasisekhara [Lord Siva]

is unable to see You, what chance is there for me, who am lower than

an ordinary worm? I have only committed misdeeds. I know that I

am not at all fit to offer my prayers to You, but because You are

known as Dinabandhu, the friend of the fallen, I humbly pray that
You will kindly purify me by the beams of Your transcendental

glance. If I become thoroughly bathed by Your merciful glance, then
I may be saved. Therefore, my Lord, I am requesting You to please

bestow upon me Your merciful glance."

38 I Indifference and Separation

The great devotee Uddhava once wrote a letter to Kr�!J.a: "My

dear Krwa, I have j ust finished the study of all kinds of philosophical

books and Vedic verses about the goal of life, and so now I have a
little reputation for my studies. But still, in spite of my reputation,
my knowledge is condemned, because although enj oying the efful­

gence of Vedic knowledge, I could not appreciate the effulgence ema­
nating from the nails of Your toes. Therefore, the sooner my pride
and Vedic knowledge are finished, the better it will be!" This is an
example of indifference.
Another devotee very anxiously expressed himself thusly: "My
mind is very flickering, so I cannot concentrate it upon Your lotus
feet. And seeing this inefficiency in myself I become ashamed, and
the whole night I am unable to sleep because I am exasperated by my
great inability."
In the

K[§"[ta-karr;tiimrta Bilvamarigala Thakur has explained his

restlessness as follows: "My dear Lord, Your naughtiness in boyhood
is the most wonderful thing in the three worlds. And You Yourself
know what this naughtiness is. As such, You can very easily under­
stand my flickering mind. This is known to You and myself. There­
fore, I am simply yearning to know how I can fix my mind on Your
lotus feet."
Another devotee expressed his impudency by saying: "My dear
Lord, without considering my lowly position, I must confess to You

that my eyes are j ust like black wasps, desiring to hover at Your lotus
feet."

In the Seventh Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, 4th Chapter, 27th
313

314

The Nectar of Devotion

verse, the great sage Narada informs Maharaj Yudhi9thira about

!I i
I

Prahlada Maharaj, who was a devotee from the very beginning of his

�I

life. The proof ofPrahlada's natural devotion is that even when he was
a small child he did not play with his playmates, but was always eager
to preach the glories of the Lord. Instead of joining in their sportive
acrobatic feats, he remained as an inactive child because he was
always in trance, meditating on Kr9�a. As such, there was no possi­
bility of his being touched by the external world.

The following statement is about a briihmar;w devotee: "This briih­

marra is very expert in all kinds of activities, but I do not know why
he is looking up without moving his eyes. It appears that his body is
fixed motionless just like a doll's. In this condition, I can guess that
he has been captivated by the transcendental beauty of that expert

Sri Kr9�a, and, being attached to Him, he is simply
staring at the black cloud, remembering the bodily hue of Sri Kr9�a."
flute-player,

This is an example of how a devotee can become inert due to ecstatic
love.

In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam,

Seventh Canto, 4th Chapter, 30th

verse, Prahlada Maharaj says that even in his childhood, when he was
loudly speaking the glories of the Lord, he used to dance just like a
shameless madman. And sometimes, being fully absorbed in thought
on the pastimes of the Lord, he used to imitate such pastimes. This is
an instance of a devotee's being almost like a madman. Similarly, it is
said that the great sage Narada was so ecstatically in love with Kr9�a
that he would sometimes dance naked, and sometimes his whole
body would become stunned. Sometimes he would laugh very loudly,
sometimes he would cry very loudly, sometimes he would remain
silent, and sometimes he would appear to be suffering from some
disease, although he had no disease. This is another instance of be­
I

i

�I
�

coming like a madman in the ecstasy of devotion.
In the Hari-bhak ti-sudhodaya it is stated that when Prahlada Maharaj
was thinking himself unfit to approach the Supreme Personality of
Godhead, he immersed himself in great distress, in an ocean of un­
happiness. As such, he used to shed tears and lie down on the floor as
though unconscious.
The students of a great devotee once talked amongst themselves in
this way: "My dear Godbrothers, our spiritual master, after seeing the

Indifference and Separation

315

lotus feet of the Lord, has thrown himself into the fire of lamenta­

tion, and because of this fire the water of his life has almost dried
away. Let us now pour the nectar of the holy name through his ears,

and by doing so the swan of his life may again show signs of life."
When Lord Kr�pa went to the city of Sol).itapura to fight with

Bali's son Bapa and to cut off all his hands, U ddhava, being separated

from Kr�pa and thinking of His fight, was almost completely stunned

into unconsciousness.

When a devotee is fully in love with the Supreme Personality of

Godhead, there may be the following symptoms due to his feelings

of separation from the Lord: feverish condition of the body, wither­

ing of the body, lack of sleep, nonattachment, inertness, appearing

diseased, madness, unconsciousness and sometimes death.

As far as the feverish condition of the body is concerned, Uddhava

once told Narada, "My dear great sage, the lotus flower that is a

friend of the sun may be a cause of distress for us; and the fire in the

ocean may cause us some burning sensation; and Indivara, the friend
of a demon, may distress us in various ways-we do not mind. But
the most regrettable factor is that all of them remind us of Krwa,

and this is giving us too much distress!" This is an instance of the

feverish condition which is due to being separated from Kr�pa.

Some of the devotees who went to see Krwa at Dvaraka and were

detained at the door said: "My dear Krwa, 0 friend of the PapQ.us, as

the swan loves to dive into the water amongst the lily flowers and

would die if he were taken from the water, so we only wish to be
with You. Our limbs are being shrunken and faded because You have

been taken away from us."

The King of Bahula, although very comfortably situated in his

palace, began to think the nights very long and distressing because of

his separation from Kr�pa.

King Yudhi�thira once said, "Kr�pa, the chariot driver of Arjuna,

is the only relative of mine within the three worlds. Therefore, my
mind is becoming maddened day and night with separation from His

lotus feet, and I do not know how to situate myself or where I shall
go to attain any steadiness of mind." This is another example of lack
of sleep.

Some of the cowherd friends of Kr�l).a said, "My dear Kn>pa, 0

316

The Nectar of Devotion

enemy of the Mura demon, just think of Your personal servant
Raktaka. Simply because he saw a peacock feather he is now closing

his eyes and is no longer attentive to pasturing the cows. Rather, he
has left them in a faraway pasture and has not even bothered to use

his stick to control them." This is an instance of mental imbalance

due to separation from Kn;�a.

When Lord Kr��a went to the capital of King Yudhi�thira, Uddhava

was so afflicted by the fire of separation from Sr1 Kr��a that the
perspiring water from his enflamed body and the tears from his eyes
poured from him, and in this way he became completely stunned.

When Sr1 Kr��a left the city of Dvaraka to seek out the Syamantaka

jewel, He was late returning home. Uddhava became so afflicted that

the symptoms of disease became manifest on his body. Actually, due
to his excessive ecstatic love for Kr��a, Uddhava became known in
Dvaraka as crazy. To his great fortune, on that day Uddhava's repu­

tation as a crazy fellow was firmly established. Uddhava 's craziness

was practically proved when he went to Raivataka Hill to minutely
observe the congested black clouds. In his disturbed condition, he

began to pray to these clouds, and he expressed his jubilation by
bowing down before them.

Uddhava informed Kr��a, "My dear leader of the Yadu dynasty,

Your servants in Vrndavana cannot sleep at night thinking of You, so

now they are all lying down on the bank of the Yamuna almost para­

lyzed. And it appears that they are almost dead because their breath­

ing is very slow." This is an instance of becoming unconscious due to
separation from Kr��a.

Kr��a was once informed, "You are the life and soul of all the

inhabitants of Vrndavana. So because You have left Vrndavana, all of

the servitors of Your lotus feet there are suffering. It is as if the lakes
filled with lotus flowers have dried up from the scorching heat of

separation from You." In the example given here, the inhabitants of

Vrndavana are compared to lakes filled with lotus flowers, and be­
c�use of the scorching heat of separation from Kr��a, the lakes-along
With the lotus flowers of their lives-are being burned up. And the
swans in the lakes, who are compared to the vitality of the inhabi­
tants of Vrndavana, are no longer desiring to live in that lake. In other

Indifference and Separation

317

words, because of the scorching heat, the swans are leaving the lakes.
This metaphor is used to describe the condition of the devotees
separated from Krwa.

39 I Ways of Meeting Kr��a

When Kr9�a and His devotees meet, it is technically called yoga, or

linking up with the Lord. Such meetings between K���a and His devo­

tees can be divided into three classes-namely, perfection, satisfac­
tion, and steadiness. When the devotee meets with Kr9�a in great
eagerness, that state of meeting is called perfection.

In the Kr�rw-karru"imrta, Bilvamari.gala Thakur describes how Krwa

meets His devotee-with peacock feather on His head, with marakata

jewels on His chest, with His ever-enchanting smile, His restless eyes
and His very delicate body.

In the Tenth Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam, 38th Chapter, 31st

verse, Sukadeva Gosvami tells King Parik9it: "My dear King, as soon
as Akrura the chariot driver saw Lord Kr9�a and His elder brother
Balarama in Vrndavana, he immediately got down from the chariot

and, being greatly afflicted by affection for the transcendental Lord,

fell down upon His lotus feet to offer respectful obeisances." These
are some of the instances of perfectional meetings with Kr9�a.

When a devotee meets Kr9�a after long separation, it is called satis­

faction. In the First Canto of Srimad-Bhagavatam, llth Chapter, 9th
verse, it is stated that when Lord Kr9�a returned to His capital,

Dvaraka, the inhabitants began to say, "My dear Lord, if You remain

in foreign countries for so long, we shall certainly be bereft of seeing
Your smiling face! And observing Your face, we, Your eternal servi­

tors, become greatly satisfied. All the anxieties of our existence are
immediately mitigated. If we cannot see You because You are long

absent from Dvaraka, then it will be impossible for us to live any­

more." This is an instance of satisfaction in meeting Kr9�a after long

separation.

318

Ways of Meeting Kr§T.w

319

Kr�rta's personal servant, Daruka, seeing Kr�rta at the door of
Dvaraka, forgot to offer Him respects with folded hands.
When a devotee is ultimately situated in association with Kr�rta,
his position is called steadiness in devotional service. This steady posi­

tion in devotional service is explained in the book known as Harhsa­

diita. It is described there how Akn1ra, who was considered by the

gopis to be terror personified, would talk with Kr�rta about the activi­

ties of the Kuru dynasty. A similar steady position was held by
Uddhava, the disciple of Brhaspati. He would always massage the
lotus feet of Kr�rta while kneeling down on the ground before Him.
When a devotee is engaged in the service of the Lord, it is called

the attainment of yoga. The English equivalent to the word "yoga"

is "linking up." So actual linking up with Kr�rta, the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead, begins when the devotee renders service unto Him.
Devotees situated in the transcendental rasa of servitorship render

their particular service whenever there is an opportunity. Sometimes
they sit down in front of Kr�rta to receive orders. Some persons are

reluctant to accept this level of devotional service as actual bhakti­

yoga, and in some of the Purii:!ws also this servitorship in devotional

service to Krwa is not accepted as the actual bhakti-yoga system. But
in the Srimad-Bhiigavatam it has been clearly indicated that the servi­

tor relationship with Krwa is the actual beginning of yoga realization.

In the Eleventh Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, 3rd Chapter, 33rd

verse, it is stated that when devotees are engaged in the discharge of

bhakti-yoga, sometimes they cry from thinking of Kr�rta, sometimes
they laugh, sometimes they become jubilant, and sometimes they
talk in very uncommon ways. Sometimes they dance, sometimes they
sing, sometimes they are actually engaged in the service of the Lord,
and sometimes they sit down silently as if absorbed in trance.

Similarly, in the Seventh Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, Chapter 28,

Prahlada Maharaj says to his friends: "My dear friends, as soon as pure
devotees of Lord Kr�rta hear of the transcendental pastimes of the
Lord, who is the eternal reservoir of pastimes, or hear about His tran­
scendental qualities they become overpowered with jubilation. Ec­
static symptoms are manifested in their bodies. They shed tears, talk
falteringly, glorify the Lord in a loud voice and chant and dance in
ecstasy. These ecstasies are always there, but sometimes they over-

320

The Nectar of Devotion

come all limits, and the symptoms become manifest to all."

In the process of surrender unto the Supreme Personality of God­

head there are six items: to accept everything which is favorable for

devotional service, to reject everything which is unfavorable for

devotional service, to believe that Kr��a will always give protection,

to identify oneself with Kr��a's devotees, to always feel inability
without the help of Kr��a, and to always think oneself inferior to
Kr��a, even though one may have full capacity to perform something

on his own. When one is substantially convinced that he is always
protected by Kr��a in all circumstances,that feeling is called reveren­

tial devotion. Reverential devotion is executed in relation with the
Supreme Personality of Godhead and with His other protected devo­

tees.

When Kr��a was residing in Dvaraka, some of the elderly members

of the Yadu family would occasionally put some important matter
before Him. At such a time, Krwa would carefully give attention to

those matters. And if there were some humorous topics mentioned,
Kr��a would immediately respond with a smiling face. Sometimes

when Krwa was executing His duties in the assembly known as Su­

dharma, He would ask the elderly members for good advice. By such
activities He is manifest as the supreme spiritual master, the supreme

executive head, the superior intelligence, the supreme power, protec­
tor and maintainer.

40 I Reverential Devotion
of Sons and Other Subordinates

True reverential devotion is exhibited by persons who think them­

selves subordinate to Kr��a and by persons who think themselves
sons of Kr��a. The best examples of this subordination are Sara�a,
Gada and Subhadra. They were all members of the Yadu dynasty,

and they used to always think themselves protected by Kr��a. Simi­

larly, Kr��a's sons, such as Pradyumna, Carude��a, and Samba, felt

the same way. Kr��a had many sons in Dvaraka. He begot ten sons

by each of His 16,108 queens, and all of these sons, headed by

Pradyumna, Carude��a and Samba, used to think themselves always

protected by Kr��a. When Kr��a's sons dined with Him, they would
sometimes open their mouths for Kr��a to feed them. Sometimes

when Kr��a would pat one of His sons, the son would sit on Krwa's

lap, and while Kr��a was blessing the son's head by smelling it, the

others would shed tears, thinking how many pious activities he must

have performed in his previous life. Out of Kr��a's many sons,

Pradyumna, a son of Kr��a's chief queen, Rukmi�i, is considered the

leader. Pradyumna's bodily features resembled Kr��a's exactly. Pure

devotees of Kr��a glorify Pradyumna because he is so fortunate: like
father like son.

There is a description in the Hari-vamsa of Pradyumna's activities

when he kidnapped Prabhavati. Pradyumna addressed Prabhavati at

that time and said: "My dear Prabhavati, just look at the head of our

family, Sri Kr��a: He is Vi��u Himself, the supreme driver of Garu�a,

and He is our supreme master. Because we have become so proud and
confident of His protecting us, we sometimes do not even care about

fighting with Tripurari [Lord Siva]."
321

322

The Nectar of Devotion

There are two kinds of devotees engaged in devotional service with

awe and veneration, and the servitors in the abode of Dvaraka always

worship Kr��a as the most respectable and revered Personality of

Godhead. They are captivated by Kr��a because of His super-excellent

opulences. The members who always thought themselves protected
by Kr��a could readily convert their conviction into practical demon­

stration, because it was sometimes found that the sons of Kn;!la acted

very unlawfully in various places. Nonetheless they were given full
protection by Kr�!la and Balarama.
Even Balarama, the elder brother of Kr��a, sometimes unknowingly
offered respect to Him. Once when Kn;�a came before Lord Balarama,
He was anxious to offer His respects to His elder brother, but at that
time Balarama's club was lowered down upon Kr��a's lotus feet. In
other words, the club in Balarama's hand offered its own respects to
Kr�!J.a. These feelings of subordination, as explained above, are some­

times manifested as anubhiiva.

When demigods from the heavenly planets came to Sri Kr�!J.a, all

of Kr��a's sons followed them, and Lord Brahma sprinkled water
from his kamar4alu upon them. When the demigods came before

Krwa, instead of sitting on golden chairs, the sons sat down on the

floor, which was covered with deerskin.

Sometimes the behavior of Kr�!la's sons appears similar to the be­

havior of His personal servants. For example, the sons used to offer

their obeisances, they were silent, submissive and gentle, and they
were always ready to carry out Kr��a's orders, even at the risk of life.

When present before Kr��a, they bowed down on the ground. They
were very silent and steady, and they used to restrain coughing and

laughing before the Lord. Also, they never discussed Krwa's pastimes
in conjugal love. In other words, devotees who are engaged in rever­

ential devotional service should not discuss the conjugal love affairs

of Kr��a. No one should claim his eternal relationship with Kr��a un­

less he is liberated. In the conditioned state of life, the devotees have
to execute the prescribed duties as recommended in the codes of de­

votional service. When one is mature in devotional service and is a
realized soul, he can know his own eternal relationship with Krwa.

One should not artificially try to establish some relationship. In the

Reverential Devotion of Sons and Other Subordinates

323

premature stage it is sometimes found that a lusty, conditioned per­
son will artificially try to establish some relationship with Kr�!la in
conjugal love. The result of this is that one becomes prakrta-sahajiyii,
or one who takes everything very cheaply. Although such persons
may be very anxious to establish a relationship with Kr�!la in con­
jugal love, their conditioned life in the material world is still most
abominable. A person who has actually established his relationship
with Kr9!1a can no longer act on the material plane, and his personal
character cannot be criticized.
When Cupid came on one occasion to visit Lord Kr9!1a, some devo­
tee addressed him thus: "My dear Cupid, because you have been so
fortunate as to have placed your eyesight on the lotus feet of Kr�!la,
the drops of perspiration on your body have become frozen, and
they resemble kar-taki fruits [a kind of a small fruit found in thorny
bushes] . " These are signs of ecstasy and veneration unto the Supreme
Personality of Godhead. When the princes of the Y adu dynasty heard
the vibration of Kr�!!a's Paficajanya conchshell, the hairs on their
bodies immediately stood up in ecstatic jubilation. It seemed at that
time that all the hairs on the bodies of the princes were dancing in
ecstasy.
In addition to jubilation, there are sometimes symptoms of disap­
pointment. Pradyumna once addressed Samba with these words: "My
dear Samba, you are such a glorified personality! I have seen that
once when you were playing on the ground, your body became
covered with dust; yet, our father, Lord Kr9!1a, still took you up on
His lap. But I am so unfortunate that I could never get such love
from our father!" This statement is an example of disappointment in
love.
To regard Kr�!la as one's superior is called reverential feeling, and
when, in addition to this, a devotee feels that Kr�!la is his protecJor,
his transcendental love for Krsna is increased, and his combined feel.

.

.

ings are called reverential devotion. When this steady reverential devotion increases further, it is called love of Godhead in reverential de­
votion. Attraction and affection are two prominent symptoms of this
stage. In tliis reverential devotional attitude, Pradyumna never talked
to his father in a loud voice. In fact, he never so much as unlocked

324

The Nectar of Devotion

the lips of his mouth, nor did he ever show his face filled with tears.
He would always glance only at the lotus feet of his father.

There is another example of steady and fixed love for Krwa in the

instance of Arjuna's informing Him of the death of Arjuna's son,

Abhimanyu, who was also the nephew of Kr��a. Abhimanyu was the
son of Subhadra, Kr��a's younger sister. He was killed at the Battle

of Kuruk�etra by the combined efforts of all the commanders in
King Duryodhana's army-namely, Kar�a, Asvatthama, Jayadratha,

Blu�ma, Krpacarya and Dro�acarya. In order to assure Kn>�a that

there was no change of love on Subhadra's part, Arjuna informed
Him: "Although Abhimanyu was killed almost in Your presence,

Subhadra's love for You is not agitated at all, nor has it even slightly

changed its original color."

The affection that Krwa has for His devotees was expressed by

Himself when He asked Pradyumna not to feel so bashful before

Him. He addressed Pradyumna thus: "My dear boy, just give up your

inferiority complex, and do not hang your neck. Just talk with Me in
a clear voice, and do not shed tears. You can look straight at Me, and

you can place your hands on My body without any hesitation. There
is no need of exhibiting so much reverence before your father."

Pradyumna 's attachment for Kr��a was always exhibited by his

action. Whenever he was ordered by his. father to execute something,

he would immediately execute the order, taking the task as nectarean
even though it may have been poison. Similarly, whenever he would

find something to be disapproved of by his father, he would im­

mediately reject it as poison, even though it may have been nectarean.

Pradyumna's attachment in anxiety for Kr��a was expressed when

he said to his wife Rati: "The enemy, Sambara, is already killed. Now
I am very anxious to see my father, who is my spiritual master and
who always carries the conchshell known as Paiicajanya." Pradyumna

felt great separation from Kr��a when He was absent from Dvaraka
at the battlefield of Kuruk�etra. He said, "Since my father has left
Dvaraka, I do not take much pleasure in practicing fighting, nor am I

interested in any kind of sporting pastimes. And what need is there
to speak of these things? I do not even wish to stay at Dvaraka in the
absence of my father."

I.

Reverential Devotion of Sons and Other Subordinates

325

When Pradyumna came back home after killing the Sambarasura,

and as soon as he saw his father, Kr��a, before him, he became so

overjoyed that he himself could not understand his jo_y on that
occasion. This is an instance of success in separation. A similar satis­

faction was observed when Kr��a returned from the battlefield of
Kuruk�etra to His home at Dvaraka. All of His sons were so over­

joyed that, out of ecstasy, they repeatedly made many mistakes.
These mistakes were a sign of complete satisfaction.

Every day Pradyumna looked over Kr��a 's lotus feet with tears in

his eyes. These signs of reverential devotion on the part of Pradyumna

can be described in the same way they have been described in the
case of other devotees.

41 I Fraternal Devotion

When a devotee is permanently situated in devotional service, and
by different symptoms of ecstasy he has developed and matured a
fraternal mellow or flavor in relationship with the Personality of
Godhead, at that time his feeling is called fraternal love of Godhead.
The impetus for such fraternal love of God is God Himself. When
one is liberated and discovers his eternal relationship with the Su·
preme Lord, the Lord Himself becomes the impetus for increasing
fraternal love. The eternal associates of the Lord in Vrndavana have
described this as follows: "The Lord, Hari, whose bodily hue is like
the indranila jewel, whose smiling is as beautiful as the kunda flower,
whose silk dress is as yellow as golden autumn foliage, whose chest
is beautified with garlands of flowers and who is always playing upon
His flute-this enemy of the Agha demon is always attracting our
hearts by wandering about Vrndavana."
There are similar statements of fraternal love expressed outside the
jurisdiction of Vrndavana. When the sons of Pap�u, headed by
Maharaj

Yudhi�thira, saw Kr�pa in His fourhanded form on the

battlefield of Kuruk�etra, holding His conchshell, disk, club and lotus
flower, they completely forgot themselves and became merged in the
ocean of nectarean happiness. This shows how the sons of Pap�u­
King Yudhi�thira, Bhima, Arjuna, Nakula and Sahadeva-were all
caught up in fraternal love for Kr�pa.
Sometimes the different names, forms, paraphernalia and transcen­
dental qualities provoke fraternal love: For instance, Kr�pa's nice
dress, the all-auspicious symptoms on His body, His strongly-built
body, His knowledge of different languages, His learned teachings
326

Fraternal Devotion

327

in the Bhagavad-gitii, His uncommon genius in all fields of endeavor,
His exhibition of expert knowledge, His mercy, His chivalry, His be­

havior as a conjugal lover, His intelligence, His forgiveness, His at­
traction for all kinds of men, His opulence and His happiness-all
provoke fraternal love.
The impetus to fraternal love upon seeing the associates of Kr�!la

in Vrndavana is also very natural, for their personal bodily features,

their qualities and dress are all equal to Kr�!la's. These associates are

always happy in their service to Kr�!la, and they are generally known

as vayasyas, or friends of the same age. These vayasyas are fully con­
fident of protection by Kr9!la. Devotees sometimes pray: "Let us of­

fer our respectful obeisances unto the vayasyas of Kr9!1a, who are

firmly convinced of Kr9!!a's friendship and protection and whose de­

votion to Krwa is ever-fixed. They are fearless, and on a level equal

with Kr�!la they discharge their transcendental loving devotional ser­

vice." Such eternal vayasyas are also found beyond the jurisdiction of

Vrndavana, in places such as Dvaraka and Hastinapura. Except for

Vrndavana, all the places of Kr�!!a's pastimes are called puras (towns).
Mathura and Hastinapura, the capital of the Kurus, are both puras.

Personalities like Arjuna, Bhima, Draupadl and Srldama Brahma!la
are counted amongst Kr9!la's fraternal devotees in the puras.

How the sons of Pa!!�u, the Pa!l�avas, enjoy Kr9!1a's association is

described as follows: "When Sri Kr9!1a arrived in Indraprastha, the

capital of the Kurus, Maharaj Yudhi�thira immediately came out to
smell the flavor of Kr�!la's head." It is the Vedic custom that su­

periors smell the heads of their subordinates when the subordinates

offer respect to the superior by touching his feet. Similarly, Arjuna

and Bhlma embraced Kr�!!a with great jubilation, and the two young­

er brothers, namely Nakula and Sahadeva, touched the lotus feet of

Kr9!1a with tears in their eyes and offered their respects. In this way

all the five Pa!!�ava brothers enjoyed the fraternal friendship of

Krwa in transcendental mellow. Of the five Pa!l�avas, Arjuna is the

most intimately connected with Kr�!la. He has a nice bow in his hand
which is called Ga!l�lva. His thighs are compared with the trunks of

elephants, and his eyes are always reddish. When Kr�!la and Arjuna
are together on a chariot, they become celestial beauties, pleasing to

328

The Nectar of Devotion

the eyes of everyone. It is said that once Arjuna was lying in his bed

with his head upon Kr�t;ta's lap and was talking and joking with Kr�t;ta
in great relaxation and was enjoying Kr�t;ta's company with smiling
and great satisfaction.

As far as the vayasyas (friends) in Vrndavana are concerned, they
become greatly distressed when they cannot see Kr�t;ta even for a
moment.

There is the following prayer by a devotee for the va yasyas in

Vrndavana: "All glories to Kr�t;ta's vay asyas, who are just like Kr�t;ta
in their age, qualities, pastimes, dress and beauty. They are accus­
tomed to playing on their flutes made of palm leaves, and they all

have buffalo-horn bugles ornamented like Kr�t;ta's with jewels such as

indranila and with gold and coral. They are always jubilant like Kr�t;ta.

May these glorious companions of Krwa always protect us!"

The vayasyas in Vrndavana are in such intimate friendship with
Kr�t;ta that sometimes they think themselves as good as Kr�t;ta. Here is

an instance of such friendly feeling: When Kr�t;ta was holding up Go­

vardhan Hill with His left hand, the vayasyas said, "My dear friend,

You have been standing for the last seven days and nights without

any rest. This is very troublesome for us because we see that you

have undertaken a severely laborious task. We think, therefore, that

you need not continue to stand in that way holding the hill. You can

just transfer it onto Sudama's hand. We are very much aggrieved to

see You in this position. If You think that Sudama is not able to
support Govardhan Hill, then at least You should change hands. In­

stead of supporting it with Your left hand, please transfer it to Your

right hand, so that we can give Your left hand a massage." This is an
instance of intimacy, showing how much the vayasyas considered

themselves to be equal to Kr�t;ta.

In the Srimad B hagavata m , Tenth Canto, 12th Chapter, lOth verse,
-

Sukadeva Gosvami tells King Parik�it: "My dear King, Kr�t;ta is the

Supreme Personality of Godhead to the learned transcendentalist, He

is the supreme happiness for the impersonalist, He is the supreme
worshipable Deity for the devotee, and He is just like an ordinary

boy to one who is under the spell of maya. And just imagine-these

cowherd boys are now playing with the Supreme Person as though

Fraternal Devotion

329

they are on an equal level! By this anyone can understand that these
boys must have accumulated heaps of the results of pious activities to
enable them to associate with the Supreme Personality of Godhead
in such intimate friendship."
There is a description of Kr�!la's feeling for his vayasyas in Vrnda­
vana. He once said to Balarama, "My dear brother, when My com­
panions were being devoured by the Aghasura, hot tears poured down
from My eyes. And as they were washing My cheeks, My dear elder
brother, for at least one moment I completely lost Myself."
Within Gokula, Kr�!la's vayasyas are generally divided into four
groups:

l) well-wishers, 2) friends, 3) confidential friends and 4) inti­

mate friends. Kr�!la's well-wisher friends are a little bit older than
Kr�!la, and they have some parental affection for Him. Because of
their being older than Kr�!la they always try to protect Him from any
harm. As such, they sometimes bear weapons so that they can chas­
tise any mischievous persons who want to do harm to Krwa. Counted
amongst

the

well-wisher friends

are

Subhadra,* Ma!l9-alibhadra,

Bhadravardhana, Gobhata, Y ak�a, lndrabhata, Bhadrihi.ga, Virabhadra,
Mahagu!la, Vijaya, and Balabhadra. They are older than Kr�!la and
are always thinking of His welfare.
One of the elderly friends said, "My dear Ma!l9-alibhadra, why
are you wielding a shining sword as though you were running
towards Ari�tasura to kill him? My dear Baladeva, why are you un­
necessarily bearing that heavy plow? My dear Vijaya, don't be un­
necessarily agitated. My dear Bhadravardhana, there is no need to
make these threatening motions. If you will all look more closely
you will see that it is only a thunder cloud upon Govardhana Hill; it
is not the Ari�tasura in the shape of a bull, as you have imagined."
These older, well-wishing friends of Kr�!la imagined a large cloud to
be the Ari�tasura, appearing in the shape of a huge bull. In the midst
of their excitement one of them ascertained that it was actually only
a cloud on Govardhan Hill. He therefore informed the others not to
take the trouble of worrying about Kr�!la, because there was no pres­
ent danger from Ari�tasura.
*

Not to be confused with Kr��a's sister of the same name.

330

The Nectar of Devotion

Amongst the well-wisher friends, Mal).�alibhadra and Balabhadra
are the chiefs. Mal).�alibhadra is described as follows: his complexion
is yellowish, and his dress is very attractive. He always carries a stick
of various colors. He wears a peacock feather on his head and always
looks very beautiful. Mal).�alibhadra's attitude is revealed in his state­
ment: "My dear friends, our beloved Kr�l).a is now very tired from
working with the cows in the pasturing grounds and from traveling
all over the forests. I can see that He is very fatigued. Let me massage
His head silently while He is taking rest in His house. And you,
Subala-you just massage His thighs."
One devotee described the personal beauty of Baladeva as follows:
"Let me take shelter of the lotus feet of Balarama, whose beauty is
enhanced by the earrings touching his cheeks. His face is decorated
with tilaka made from kasturi (musk), and His broad chest is deco­
rated with a garland of gunja (small conchshells). His complexion is
as white as an autumn cloud, He wears garments of blue color, and
His voice is very grave. His arms are very long, touching His thighs,
and He has shown His great strength by killing the Pralamba demon.
Let me take shelter of this chivalrous Balarama. "*
Baladeva's affection for Kn>l).a is illustrated in this statement to
Subala: "My dear friend, please inform Krwa not to go to Kaliya's
lake today. Today is His birthday, and so I wish to go along with
Mother Y asoda to bathe Him. Tell Him He should not leave the house
today." This shows how Balarama, Kg;!). a's elder brother, took care
of Kn>pa with parental love, within the scope of fraternal affection.
Friends who were younger than Krwa, who were always attached
to Him and who gave Him all kinds of service, are called ordinary
friends, or, simply, friends. Such ordinary friends are called sakhiis,

\I
!

and the names of some sakhiis are Visala, Vr�abha, Ojasvi, Deva­
prastha, Varuthapa, Maranda, Kusumap'i�a, Mapibandha, and Karan­
dhama. All of these sakhii friends of Kr�pa sought only to serve Him.

,I

Sometimes some of them would rise early in the morning and im­

II

mediately go to Kn>l).a's place and wait at the door to see Krwa and

I'

.,. Balarama and Baladeva are different names for the same expansion of Kn�1a. He
is Kn;�a's elder brother.

Fraternal Devotion

331

to accompany Him to the pasturing grounds. In the meantime, Kr�!la

would be dressed by Mother Yasoda, and when she would see a boy

standing at the door, she would call him: "Well, Visala, why are you

standing there? Come here!" So with the permission of Mother

Yasoda, he would immediately enter the house. And while Mother

Yasoda was dressing Kr�!ia, he would try to help put on Kn;!la's
ankle bells, and Kr�!la would jokingly strike him with His flute. Then

Mother Yasoda would call, "Kr�l).a, what is this? Why are You teasing

Your friend?" And Kr�!la would laugh, and the friend would also

laugh. These are some of the activities of Kr�!!a's sakhiis. Sometimes

the sakhiis would take care of the cows who were going hither and

thither. They would tell Krwa, "Your cows were going off here and
there," and Kr�!ia would thank them.

Sometimes when Krwa and His sakhiis went to the pasturing

ground, Kamsa would send a demon to kill Krwa. Therefore, almost
every day there was a fight with some different kind of demon. After

fighting with a demon, Kr�!ia would feel fatigued, the hairs on His
head would be scattered, and the sakhiis would immediately come

and try to relieve Him in different. ways. Some friends would say,

"My dear Visala, please take this fan of lotus leaves and fan Kr�!la so

that He may feel some comfort. Varuthapa, you just brush the scat­

tered hairs on Kr�!!a's head which have fallen upon His face_ Vr�abha,

don't talk unnecessarily! Immediately massage Kr�!!a's body. His
arms have become tired from fighting and wrestling with that demon.

Oh, just see how our friend Kr?!la has become tired!" These are some

examples of the treatment given to Kr�!la by the sakhiis.

One of the sakhiis, known as Devaprastha, is described as follows:

he is very strong, a ready scholar, and is very expert in playing ball.

He wears a white dress, and he ties his hair into a bunch with a rope.

Whenever there is a fight between Krwa and the demons, Devaprastha
is the first to help, and he fights just like an elephant.

One of the gopis once said to her friend, "My dear beautiful

friend, when Kr�!ia, the son of Maharaj N anda, was taking rest within

the cave of a hill, He was keeping His head on the arms of Sri'dama,
and He was putting His left hand on Dama's chest. Taking this op­
portunity, Devaprastha, out of his strong affection for Kr�!la, im-

332

The Nectar of Devotion

mediately began to massage His legs." Such are the activities of
Kr�l).a's friends out on the pasturing grounds.

The more confidential friends are called priya-sakhiis and are al­

most Kr�l).a's age. Because of their very confidential friendship, their
behavior is only on the basis of pure friendship. Other friends' be­

havior is on the ground of paternal love or servitude, but the basic

principle of the confidential friends is simply friendship on an equal
level. Some confidential friends are as follows: Sridama, Sudama,
Dama, Vasudama, Kinkil).i, Stokakr�l).a, Arhsu, Bhadrasena, Vilasina,

Pul)-9-arika, Vitanka and Kalavinka. By their various activities in dif­

ferent pastimes, all of these friends used to give transcendental pleas­

ure to Kr�l).a.

The behavior of these confidential friends is described by a friend

of Radharal).i, who told Radharal).i: "My dear graceful Radharal).i,

Your intimate friend, Kr�l).a, is also served by His intimate boy

friends. Some of them cut jokes with Him in mild voices and please
Him very much by this." For example, Kr�l).a had one briihmar-a

friend whose name was Madhumangala. This boy would joke by

playing the part of a greedy briihmar-a. Whenever the friends ate, he
would eat more than all others, especially lii��us, of which he was
very fond. Then after eating more lii��us than anyone else, Madhu­

mangala would still not be satisfied, and he would say to Kr�l).a, "If

You give me one more lii��u, then I shall be pleased to give You my

blessings so that Your friend Radharal).i will be very much pleased
with You." The briihmar-as are supposed to give blessings to the

vaisyas (farming and merchant caste), and Kr�l).a presented Himself

as the son of Maharaj Nanda, a vaisya; so the briihmar-a boy was

right in giving blessings to Kr�l).a. Thus Kr�l).a was very pleased by

His friend's blessings, and He would supply him with more and more
lii��us.

Sometimes a confidential friend would come before Kr�l).a and

embrace Him with great affection and love. Another friend would

then come up from the rear and cover Kr�l).a's eyes with his hands.
Krwa would always feel very happy by such dealings with His confi­

dential friends.

Out of all these confidential friends, Sridama is considered to be

Fraternal Devotion

333

the chief. Sridama used to put on a yellow-colored dress. He would
carry a buffalo horn, and his turban was of reddish, copper color. His

bodily complexion was blackish, and around his neck there was a
nice garland. He would always challenge Kr�l).a in joking friendship.
Let us pray to Sridama to bestow his mercy upon us!

Sometimes Sridama used to address Krwa: "Oh, You are so cruel

that You left us alone on the bank of Yamuna, and we were all mad
from not seeing You there! Now it is our great fortune that we are

able to see You here. If You want to pacify us, You must embrace
each one of us with Your arms. But believe me, my dear friend, a

moment's absence from You creates great havoc, not only for us but

for the cows also. Everything becomes disarranged, and we become
mad after You."

There are other friends who are still more confidential. They are

called pri_ya-narma, or intimate friends. Counted among the pri_ya­

narma friends are Subala, Arjuna, Gandharva, Vasanta and Ujj vala.
There was talk among the friends of Radharal).'i, the gopis, about

these most intimate friends. One gopi addressed Radharal).i thusly:
"My dear Krsangi [delicate one], just see how Subala is whispering

Your message into Kn;l).a's ear, how he is delivering the confidential

letter of Syamadasi silently into Kr�l).a's hand, how he is delivering
the betel nuts prepared by Palika into Kr�l).a's mouth, and how he is

decorating Krwa with the garland prepared by Taraka. Did you

know, my dear friend, that all these most intimate friends of Kr�l).a
are always engaged in His service in this way?" Out of the many inti­
mate pri_ya-narmas, Subala and Ujj vala are considered to be the most

prominent.

Subala's body is described as follows. His complexion is just like
molten gold. He is very, very dear to Kr�l).a. He always has a garland

around his neck, and he wears yellow clothing. His eyes are just like
lotus flower petals, and he is so intelligent that by his talking and his

moral instructions, all the other friends take the highest pleasure. Let
us all offer our respectful obeisances unto Kn>l).a's friend Subala!

The degree of intimacy shared by Kr�pa and Subala can be under­

stood by the fact that the talks between them were so confidential
that no one else could understand what they were saying.

334

The Nectar of Devotion

The description of Ujjvala, another intimate friend, is given as fol­
lows. Ujjvala always wears some garment of orange color, and the
movements of his eyes are always very restless. He likes to decorate
himself with all kinds of flowers, his bodily hue is almost like Krwa's,
and on his neck there is always a necklace of pearls. He is always very
dear to Kr��a. Let us all worship Ujjvala, the most intimate friend of
Kr��a!
About the confidential service of Ujjvala, this statement is to be
found, addressed by Radhara�i to one of Her friends: "My dear
friend, it is impossible for Me to keep My prestige! I wanted to avoid
talking to Kr��a anymore-but just see! There again is His friend,
Ujjvala, coming to Me with his canvassing work. His entreaties are so
powerful that it is very difficult for a gopi to resist her love for
Kr�pa, even though she may be very bashful, devoted to her family
duties and most faithful to her husband."
The following is a statement by Ujjvala, showing his jubilant na­
ture: "My dear Kr�pa, 0 killer of Aghasura, You have extended Your
loving affairs so much that You can be compared to the great ocean,
which is without limitations. At the same time, the young girls of the
world who are all searching after the perfect lover have become just
like rivers running into this ocean. Under the circumstances, all these
rivers of young girls may try to divert their courses to some other
place, but at the end they must come unto You."
Amongst the groups of different friends of Kr��a, some are well­
known from various scriptures, and some are well-known by popular
tradition. There are three divisions amongst Krwa's friends: some are
eternally in friendship with Kr�pa, some are elevated demigods, and
some are perfected devotees. In all of these groups there are some
who by nature are fixed in Kr�pa's service and are always engaged in
giving counsel; some of them are very fond of joking and naturally
cause Kr��a to smile by their words; some of them are by nature very
simple, and by their simplicity they please Lord Kr�pa; some of them

create wonderful situations by their activities, apparently against

,,

�

Krwa; some of them are very talkative, always arguing with Kr��a

Fraternal Devotion

335

'

and creating a debating atmosphere; and some of them are very gen­
tle and give pleasure to Kr�pa by their sweet words. All of these
friends are very intimate with Kr�pa, and they show expertise in their
different activities, their aim always being to please Kr�pa.

·
42 I Fraternal Loving Affairs

Kr�!!a's age, His beauty, His bugle, His flute, His conchshell and
His pleasing attitude all provoke love in friendship for Him. His

exceptional joking abilities, exhibited sometimes by His pretending

to be a royal prince, or even the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
also give impetus to devotees developing love for Kr�!la in friendship.

Learned scholars have divided Kr�!la's age into three periods: the

age up to five years is called kaumiira, the age from the sixth to the

tenth year is called paugar4a, and the age from the eleventh to fif­

teenth year is called kaisora. While Kr�!la is spending His days as a
cowherd boy, He is in the kaumiira and paugar4a ages. In the kaisora

age, when Kr�!la appeared at Gokula, He acted as a cowherd boy, and

then, when He was sixteen, He went to Mathura to kill Kamsa.

The kaumiira age is just suitable for reciprocating the love of a

child with Mother Y asoda. In the Tenth Canto, 13th Chapter, 9th
verse of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, Sukadeva Gosvami tells King Parik�it:

"My dear King, although Lord Kr�!la is the supreme enjoyer and the

beneficiary of all kinds of sacrificial ceremonies, He still used to eat
with His cowherd boy friends. This is because at that time He ac­

cepted the pastimes of an ordinary boy, keeping His flute under His

arm and His bugle on the right side in His belt, along with His cane.

In His left hand He would hold a lump of rice paste with yogurt, and

in His fingers would be pilu, the king of fruits. When He would thus

sit amongst His friends, it would appear that He was the whorl of a
lotus flower and that the friends surrounding Him were petals. As

they thus enjoyed joking amongst themselves, the denizens of heaven

would become struck with wonder and would only stare at the

scene."

Kr�pa 's paugaryJa age can be further divided into three periods­
namely, the beginning, middle and end. In the beginning of the

paugar;u;la age there is a very nice reddish luster on His lips, His ab·
domen is very thin, and on His neck are circles like those on a conch­
shell. Sometimes, some outside visitors would return to V rndavana to
see Kr�pa and, upon seeing Him again, would exclaim, "My dear
Mukunda, Your beauty is gradually increasing, just like the leaf on a
banyan tree! My dear lotus-eyed one, Your neck is gradually mani­
festing circles like the conchshell. And in the shining moonlight Your
teeth and cheeks are competing with the padmariiga jewels in their
beautiful arrangement. I am sure that Your beautiful bodily develop­
ment is now giving much pleasure to Your friends."
At this age Kr�pa was garlanded with various kinds of flowers. He
used to put on a silk dress, colored with various kinds of dye. Such
beautiful decorations are considered cosmetics for Kr�pa. Kr�pa
would wear this dress when He used to go into the forest to tend the
cows. Sometimes He would wrestle there with His different friends,
and sometimes they would dance all together in the forest. These are
some of the specific activities of the paugaryJa age.
The cowherd friends of Kr�pa were so happy in His company that
they expressed their transcendental feelings within themselves thus:
"My dear Kr�pa, You are always busy tending the cows which are
scattered all over beautiful Vrndavana. You have a beautiful garland,
a small conchshell, a peacock feather on Your turban, yellow-colored
silk cloth, decorations of kan;tikiira flowers on Your ears and a mallikii
flower garland on Your chest. Appearing so beautiful, when You
pretend, just like an actor, to be fighting with us, You give us un­
limited transcendental bliss."
When Krwa is more grown-up, in the middle age of paugar4a, His
nails become finely sharp, and His chubby cheeks become lustrous
and round. On the two sides of His waist above His belt there are
three distinct lines of folded skin, called tribali.
The cowherd boy friends of Kr�pa felt very proud of their associa­
tion with Him. At that time the tip of His nose defeated the beauty
of the sesame flowers, the luster of His cheeks defeated the glow of
pearls,· and the two sides of His body were exquisitely beautiful. In
this age Krwa wore a silk dress that glittered like lightning, His head

338

The Nectar of Devotion

was decorated with a silk turban covered with gold lace, and in His
hand He carried a stick about fifty-six inches long.* Seeing this ex­
quisitely beautiful dress of Kr�!la, one devotee addressed his friend
in this manner: "My dear friend, j ust look at Krwa! See how He is
carrying in His hand a stick which is bound up and down with golden
rings, how His turban with golden lace is showing such a beautiful
luster, and how His dress is giving his friends the highest transcen­
dental pleasure!"
At the end of Kr�!!a's paugartfla age, Kr�!!a's hair sometimes hangs
down to His hips, and sometimes it becomes scattered. In this age
His two shoulders become higher and broader, and His face is always
decorated with marks of tilaka. When His beautiful hair scatters over
His shoulders, it appears to be a goddess of fortune embracing Him,
and this embracing is highly relished by His friends. Subala once ad­
dressed Him in this way: "My dear Kesava, Your round turban, the
lotus flower in Your hand, the vertical marks of tilaka on Your fore­
head, Your kwikum-flavored musk and all of Your beautiful bodily
features are defeating me today, although I am usually stronger than
You or any of our friends. Since this is so, I do not know how these
features of Your body can fail to defeat the pride of all the young
girls of Vrndavana. When I am so defeated by this beauty, what
chance is there for those who are naturally very simple and flexible?"
At this age Kr�!la took pleasure in whispering into the ears of His
friends, and the subj ect of His talks was the beauty of the gopis,
who were j ust tarrying before them. Subala once addressed Krwa
thus: "My dear Kr�!!a, You are very cunning. You can understand
the thoughts of others; therefore I am whispering within Your ear
that all these five gopis, who are most beautiful, have been attracted
by Your dress. And I believe that Cupid has entrusted them with the
responsibility of conquering You." In other words, the beauty of the

gopis was capable of conquering Kr�!la, although Kr�!!a is the con­
queror of all universes.
*

The specific p(lstimes in this period took place in the forest known as Bhatt·

�iravana. This Bhatt�iravana, along with eleven other vanas, or forests, is still
existing in the Vrndavana area, and devotees who circumambulate the whole area
of Vrndavana can know the beauty of these forests even today.

The symptoms of the kaisora age are already described, and it is at

this age that devotees generally most appreciate Kr?9a. Kr?9a with

Radhara9'i is worshiped as Kisora-kisori. Kr?9a does not increase His

age beyond this form of kaisora, and it is confirmed in the Brahma­
sarhhitii that although He is the oldest personality and has innumer­

able different forms, His original form is always youthful. In the pic­

tures of Kr?9a on the battlefield of Kuruk?etra we can see that He is
youthful, although at that time He was old enough to have sons,

grandsons, and great grandsons. The cowherd boy friends of Kr?9a

once said, "My dear Kr?9a, You need not decorate Your body with
so many ornaments. Your transcendental features are themselves so

beautiful that You do not require any ornamentation." At this age,

whenever Kr?9a begins to vibrate His flute early in the morning, all of

His friends immediately get up from bed just to join Him in going to

the pasturing grounds. One of the friends once said, "My dear cow­

herd friends, the sound of Krsna 's flute from above Govardhan Hill
.

.

.

is telling us that we need not go to search Him out on the bank of the
Yamuna."

Parvat'i, the wife of Lord Siva, told her husband:

"My dear

Paficamukha [five-faced], just look at the Pa9�avas! After hearing

the sound of Kr?9a 's conchshell known as Paficajanya, they have
regained their strength and are just like lions."

At this age, Kr?9a once dressed Himself up exactly like Radharii!l'i,

just to create fun among His friends. He put on golden earrings; and

because He was blackish, He smeared the pulp of kunkum all over
His body in order to become as fair as She. By seeing this dress,

Kr?9a's friend Subala became very astonished.

Kr?9a sometimes played with His intimate friends by engaging in

fighting or wrestling with their arms, sometimes by playing ball,

sometimes by playing chess, sometimes by carrying one another on

the

shoulders, and sometimes by exhibiting their expertness at

whirling logs. And the cowherd friends used to please Kr?!la by

sitting together with Him on coaches or on swings, by lying together

on their beds, by joking together and by swimming in the pool. All

these activities are called anubhiiva. Whenever all the friends would

assemble in the company of Kr?9a, they would immediately engage in

340

The Nectar of Devotion

all these functions, especially in dancing together. Regarding their
wrestling, one friend once asked Kr�tJ.a, "My dear friend, 0 killer of
the Agha demon, You are very proudly wandering among Your
friends trying to exhibit Your arms as very strong. Is it that You are
envious of me? I know that You cannot defeat me in wrestling, and
I also know that You were sitting idly for a long time because You
were hopeless of defeating me."
All the friends were very daring and would risk any difficulty, he·
cause they were confident that Kr�tJ.a would help them to be vic­
torious in all adventures. They used to sit together and advise one
another what to do, sometimes inducing one another to be engaged
in welfare work. Sometimes they would offer betel nuts to one
another, decorate one another's faces with tilaka or smear pulp of
candana on one another's bodies. Sometimes, for the sake of amuse­
ment, they used to decorate their faces in strange ways. Another
business of the friends was that each of them wanted to defeat Kr�tJ.a.
Sometimes they used to snatch His clothing or snatch away the
flowers from His hands. Sometimes one would try to induce another
to decorate his body for him, and failing this, they were always ready
to fight, challenging one another to combat in wrestling. These were
some of the general activities of Krwa and His friends.
Another important pastime of the friends of Kr�tJ.a was that they
served as messengers to and from the gopis; they introduced the
gopis to Krwa and canvassed for Kr�tJ.a. When the gopis were in dis­
agreement with Kr�tJ.a, these friends would support Kr�tJ.a's side in
His presence-but when Kr�tJ.a was not present, they would support
the side of the gopis. In this way, sometimes supporting one side,
someti�es the other, they would talk very privately, with much
whispering in the ears, although none of the business was very
senous.
The servants of Kr�tJ.a were sometimes engaged in collecting flow­
ers, decorating His body with valuable ornaments and trinkets,
dancing before Him, singing, helping Him herd the cows, massaging
His body, preparing flower garlands and sometimes fanning His body.
These were some of the primary duties of the servants of Kr�!la. The
friends and servants of Kr�tJ.a were combined together in serving
Him, and all of their activities are known as anubhiiva.

Fraternal Loving Affairs

341

When Kn;�a came out from the Yamuna after chastising the

Kaliyanaga, Sridama wanted to embrace Him first, but he could not

raise his arms because of his great feeling of respect.

When Kr��a used to play on His flute, it appeared just like the

roaring of clouds in the sky during the constellation of Svati. Ac­

cording to Vedic astronomical calculation, if there is rain during the
constellation of the Svati star, any rain falling on the sea will pro­

duce pearls, and rain falling on a serpent will produce jewels. Simi­

larly, when Kn;�a's flute roared like a thundercloud under the Svati

constellation, the resulting perspiration on Sridama's body appeared

to be just like pearls.

When Kr��a and Subala were embracing one another, Sr1mat1

Radhara�i became a little envious, and hiding Her hot temperament

She said, "My dear Subala, you are very fortunate, because even in

the presence of superiors you and Kr��a have no hesitation in putting
your arms on each other's shoulders. I think it must be admitted that

in your previous lives you have succeeded in many kinds of aus­

terities." The idea is that although Radharapi was accustomed to put
Her arms on Krwa's shoulders, it was not possible for Her to do such

a thing in the presence of Her superiors, whereas Subala could do so
freely. Radhara�i therefore praised his good fortune.

When Kr��a entered the lake of Kaliya, His intimate friends be­

came so perturbed that their bodily colors faded, and they all pro­
duced horrible gurgling sounds. At that time all of them fell down on

the ground as if they were unconscious. Similarly, when there was a
forest fire all of Kr��a's friends neglected their own protection and

surrounded Kr��a on all sides to protect Him from the flames. This

behavior of the friends toward Kr��a is described by thoughtful poets
as vyabhiciiri. In vyabhiciiri ecstatic love for Kr��a there is sometimes
madness, dexterity, fear, laziness, jubilation, pride, dizziness, medi­

tation, disease, forgetfulness and humbleness. These are some of the
common symptoms in the stage of vyabhiciiri ecstatic love for Kr��a.

When there are dealings between Kr��a and His friends which are

completely devoid of any feelings of respect, and they all treat one

another on an equal level, such ecstatic love in friendship is called

sthiiyi. When one is situated in this confidential friendly relationship
with Kr��a, one shows symptoms of love such as attraction, affection,

342

The Nectar of Devotion

affinity and attachment. An example of sthiiyi was exhibited when

Arjuna* told Akn1ra: "My dear son of Gandini, please ask Kr�!la
when I shall be able to embrace Him in my arms."

When there is full knowledge of Krwa's superiority and yet in

dealings with Him on friendly terms respectfulness is completely ab­

sent, that stage is called affection. There is one brilliant example of

this affection. When the demigods, headed by Lord Siva, were offer­

ing respectful prayers to Kr�!la, describing the glorious opulences of

the Lord, Arjuna* stood before Him with his hand on His shoulders
and brushed the dust from His peacock feather.

When the Pa!l9avas were banished by Duryodhana and forced to

live incognito in the forest, no one could trace out where they were
staying. At that time, the great sage Narada met Lord Kr�!la and said,

"My dear Mukunda, although You are the Supreme Personality of

Godhead, the all-powerful person, by making friendship with You the

Pa!l9avas have become bereft of their legitimate right to the kingdom

of the world-and, moreover, they are now living in the forest incog­

nito. Sometimes they must work as ordinary laborers in someone

else's house. These symptoms appear to be very inauspicious materi­

ally, but the beauty is that the Pa!l9avas have not lost their faith and

love for You, in spite of all these tribulations. In fact, they are always

thinking of You and chanting Your name in ecstatic friendship."

Another example of acute affection for Kr�!la is given in the lOth

Canto, 15th Chapter, 15th verse of Srimad-Bhiigavatam. In the pas­

turing ground Kr�!la felt a little tired and wanted to take rest, so He
laid down on the ground. At that time, many cowherd boys assem­

bled there and with great affection began to sing suitable songs so.
that Kr�!la would rest very nicely.

There is a nice example of the friendship between Krwa and

Arjuna on the battlefield of Kuruk�etra. When the fighting was going

on, Asvatthama, the son of Dro!lacarya, unceremoniously attacked

Kr�!la, although according to the prevailing rules of chivalry one's
chariot driver should never be attacked by the enemy. But Asvatthama
*
This A rj una, living in V rndavana, is different from th�t friend of the same name
to whom Bhagavad-gitii was spoken.

Fraternal Loving Affairs

343

behaved heinously in so many ways that he did not hesitate to attack
Kn;�a's body, although Kr$�a was acting only as charioteer for
Arjuna. When Arjuna saw that Asvatthama was releasing various kinds
of arrows to hurt Krwa, he immediately stood in front of Kr��a to
intercept all of them. At that time, although Arjuna was being
harmed by those arrows, he felt an ecstatic love for Kr$�a, and the
arrows appeared to him like showers of flowers.
There is another instance of ecstatic love for Kr��a in friendship:
Once when a cowherd boy named Vr�abha was collecting flowers
from the forest to prepare a garland to be offered to Kr��a, the sun
reached its zenith, and although the sunshine was scorching hot,
Vr$abha felt it as the moonshine. That is the way of rendering tran­
scendental loving service to the Lord: When devotees are put into
great difficulties-even like the Pa�gavas, as described above-they
feel all their miserable conditions as great facilities for serving the Lord.
Another instance of Arjuna's friendship with Kn;�a is described
by Narada, who reminded Kr��a, "When Arjuna was learning the art
of shooting arrows, he could not see You for so many days. But when
You arrived there, he stopped all His activities and immediately em­
braced You." This means that even though Arjuna was engaged in
learning about the military art, he had not forgotten Kr$�a for a
moment, and as soon as there was an opportunity to see Kr$�a, he
immediately embraced Him.
One servant of Kr$�a named Patr'i once addressed Him like this:
"My dear Lord, You protected the cowherd boys from the hunger of
the Aghasura demon, and You protected them from the poisonous
affects of the Kaliya snake. And You also saved them from the fierce
forest fire. But I am suffering from Your separation, which is more
severe than the hunger of Aghasura, the poison of Lake Kaliya, and
the burning of the forest fire. So why should You not protect me
from the pangs of separation?" Another friend once told Kr$�a: "My
dear enemy of Kamsa, since You have left us, the heat of separation
has become extraordinary. And this heat is felt more severely when
we understand that in Bha�g'iravana You are being refreshed by the
waves of the cooling river known as Bhaniitanaya [Radhara�i] ."The
purport is that when Krwa was engaged with Radhara�i, the cowherd

344

The Nectar of Devotion

boys headed by Subala were feeling great separation, and that was
unbearable for them.
Another friend addressed Kr9rta thus: "My dear Kr9rta, 0 killer of
Aghasura, when You left Vrndavana to kill King Kamsa in Mathura,
all the cowherd boys became bereft of their four bhiitas [the ele­
ments of earth, water, fire and space] . And the fifth bhiita, the air,
was flowing very rapidly within their nostrils." When Kr9rta went to

I

Mathura to kill King Kamsa, all the cowherd boys became so af­
I

flicted by the separation that they almost died. When a person is dead
it is said that he has given up the five elements, known as bhiitas, as
the body again mixes with the five elements from which it was pre­
pared. In this case, although the four elements of earth, water, fire
and ether were already gone, the remaining element, air, was still very
prominent and was blowing through their nostrils furiously. In other
words, after Kr9rta left V rndavana, they were always anxious about
what would happen in His fight with King Kamsa.
Another friend once informed Kr9rta, "When one of Your friends
was feeling. much separation from You, there were tears covering his
lotus eyes, so the black drones of sleep became discouraged from
entering his eyes and left that place." When there is a lotus flower,
the black drones fly into it to collect honey. The eyes of Kr9rta's
friend are compared to the lotus flower, and because they were
full of tears the black drones of sleep could not collect honey from
his lotus eyes and therefore left the place. In other words, because he
was too much afflicted, his eyes were full of tears, and he could not
sleep. This is an example of staying up at night because of separation
from Krwa.
An example of helplessness is described in the following statement:
"Due to Krwa's departure from Vrndavana to Mathura, Kr9rta's dear­
est cowherd boys felt as mentally light as possible. They were like
fragments of cotton, lighter than the air, and were all floating in the
air without any shelter." In other words, the minds of the cowherd
boys became almost vacant on account of Kr9rta's separation, and
they are compared with fragments of cotton floating in the air with­
out any shelter. An example of impatience was also shown by the
cowherd boys when Kr9rta went to Mathura. Out of the sorrow of

Fraternal Loving Affairs

345

separation, all these boys forgot to take care of their cowherding and
tried to forget all the melodious songs they used to sing in the pas­
turing ground. At last they had no desire to live anymore, being sepa­
rated from Kn;�a.
An example of stillness was described by a friend of Kr��a, who
informed Him in Mathura that all the cowherd boys had become just
like leafless trees on the tops of hills. They appeared almost naked,
skinny and frail, and did not carry any fruits or flowers. He informed
Kr��a that all the cowherd boys residing in Vrndavana were as still as
the trees at the tops of hills. Sometimes they felt diseased from their
separation from Kr��a, and being so greatly disappointed, they were
aimlessly wandering on the banks of the Yamuna.
There is also an example of madness caused by separation from
Kr��a. When Kr��a was absent from Vrndavana, all the cowherd boys
became bewildered, and having given up all kinds of activities, they
appeared to be mad and forgot all their regular business. They were
sometimes lying down on the ground, sometimes rolling in the dust,
sometimes laughing and sometimes running very swiftly. All of these
symptoms gave them the appearance of madmen. One friend of
Krwa's criticized Him by saying, "My dear Lord, You have become
the King of Mathura after killing Kamsa, and that is very good news
for us. But at Vrndavana all the residents have become blind from
their continuous crying over Your absence. They are full only of
anxieties and are not cheered at all by Your becoming the King of
Mathura."
Sometimes there were also signs of death caused by separation
from Kr��a. Once Kr��a was told: "My dear enemy of Kamsa, be­
cause of their separation from You, the cowherd boys are suffering
too much, and they are now lying down in the valleys, breathing only
slightly. In order to sympathize with the boys' regrettable condition,
even the forest friends, the deer, are shedding tears."
In the Mathurii-khar-fla chapter of the Skanda Puriirw, there is a
description of Kr��a and Balarama, surrounded by all the cowherd
boys, always engaged in taking care of the cows and calves. When
Kr��a was met by Arjuna at a potter's shop in the city of Drupa­
danagara, because of the similarity of their bodily features they made

346

The Nectar of Devotion

intimate friendship. This is an instance of friendship caused by the
attraction of similar bodies.

In the Tenth Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, 7lst Chapter, 25th

verse, it is stated that when Kr�!la arrived in the city of lndraprastha,
Bhima was so overwhelmed with joy that, with tears in his eyes and a
smiling face, he immediately embraced his maternal cousin. Following
him were his young brothers Nakula and Sahadeva, along with

il
II

Arjuna, and they all became so overwhelmed at seeing Kr�!la that
with full satisfaction they embraced the Lord, who is known as

I

Acyuta (the infallible). There is a similar statement about the cow­

�
fIl

Kuruk�etra, all the cowherd boys came to see Him, wearing jeweled

i

I

'I\

herd boys of Vrndiivana. When Kr�!la was on the battlefield of
earrings in their ears. Becoming so greatly overjoyed, they extended
their arms and embraced Kr�!la as their old friend. These are instances
of full satisfaction in friendship with Krwa.
In the Tenth Canto, 12th Chapter, llth verse of Srimad-Bhiigavatam
it is stated that even after undergoing severe penances and austerities

and performing the yogic principles, the great mystic yogis can hardly
become eligible to achieve the dust of the lotus feet of Kr�!J.a, but the
same Personality of Godhead, Krwa, is easily available to the vision
of the residents of Vrndavana. This means there is no comparison to
these devotees' great fortune. The friendly relationship of the cow­
herd boys with Kr�!la is a particular type of spiritual ecstasy almost
similar to the ecstasy of conjugal love. It is very difficult to explain
this ecstasy of loving affairs between the cowherd boys and Kr�!J.a.
Great expert devotees like Riipa Gosvami and others express their
astonishment at the inconceivable feelings which are in Kr�!J.a and
His cowherd boy friends.
This particular type of ecstatic love shared between Krwa and His
confidential friends further develops into parental love, and on from
there it may develop into conjugal love, the most exalted humor or
mellow of ecstatic love between Lord Kr�!la and His devotees.

43 I Parenthood

When ecstatic love develops into the relationship of parenthood

and becomes steadily established, the relationship is called viitsalya­
rasa. The exhibition of this viitsalya-rasa standard of devotional ser­

vice can be found in the dealings of Krwa with His devotees who rep­

resent themselves as superior personalities like father, mother, teach­
er, etc.

Learned scholars have described the impetus of parental love for

Kr9�a, existing in the elderly personalities who are in relation with
Him, as follows: "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, whose bodi­

ly complexion is just like a bluish, new-grown lotus flower, whose

body is very delicate and whose lotus eyes are surrounded by scat­

tered hair as black as bees, was walking on the streets of V rndavana

when Mother Yasoda, the beloved wife of Nanda Maharaj, saw Him.

Immediately the milk began to flow from her breasts, soaking her

body." Some specific provocations for parental love of Krwa are
listed as His blackish bodily hue, which is very attractive and pleasing

to see, His all-auspicious bodily features, His mildness, His sweet
words, His simplicity, His shyness, His humility, His constant readi­

ness to offer respect to the elderly, and His charity. All of these
qualities are considered ecstatic provocations for parental love.

In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, Tenth Canto, 8th Chapter, 35th verse,

it is stated by Sukadeva Gosvami that Mother Yasoda accepted Lord
Kr9�a as her son, although He is accepted in the Vedas as the King of

heaven, in the Upani§ads as the impersonal Brahman and in philoso­
phy as the supreme male. By the yogis He is accepted as the super­
soul and by the devotees as the Supreme Personality of Gochead.
347

348

The Nectar of Devotion

Once Mother Y asoda addressed one of her friends in this way:
"Nanda Maharaj, the leader of the cowherdsmen, worshiped Lord
Viwu along with me, and as a result of this worshiping Kr�!la has
been saved from the clutches of Putana and other demons. The twin

arjuna trees were, of course, broken due to a strong wind, and al­
though Kr�!la appeared to have lifted Govardhan Hill along with
Balarama, I think that Nanda Maharaj actually held the mountain.
Otherwise how could it have been possible for a little boy to lift such
a great hill?" This is another example of ecstasy in parental love. This
kind of parental love is generated in a devotee out of his conviction,
in love, that he himself is superior to Kr�!la and that without being
taken care of by such devotee Kr�!la could not possibly live. One devo­
tee therefore prayed to the parents of Lord Kr�!la as follows: "Let
me take shelter of the elderly parental devotees of Lord Kr�pa. They
are always anxious to serve Kr�pa and to maintain Him, and they are
always so kind to Him. Let us offer our respectful obeisances unto
them for being so kind to the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who
is the parent of the whole universe!"
There is a similar prayer by a briihmarta who says, "Let others wor­
ship the Vedas and the Upani§ads, and let others worship the Mahii­

bhiirata if they are afraid of material existence and want to become
liberated from that condition. But as far as I am concerned, I wish
only to worship Maharaj Nanda because the supreme absolute Per­
sonality of Godhead, Kr�!la, is crawling in his courtyard as his own
child."
Following is a list of respectful personalities who enjoy parental
affection toward Kr�pa: l) Mother Yasoda, the Queen of Braja, 2)
Maharaj Nanda, the King of Braja, 3) Mother Rohi!li, the mother of
Balarama, 4) all the elderly gopis whose sons were taken away by
Lord Brahma, 5) Devaki, the wife of Vasudeva, 6) the other fifteen
wives of Vasudeva, 7) Kunti, the mother of Arjuna, 8) Vasudeva, the
real father of Kr�pa, and 9) Sandipani Muni, Kr�!la's teacher. All
these are considered respectable elderly personalities with parental
love for Krwa. This list is in order of superior importance, and thus
we can see that Mother Yasoda and Maharaj Nanda are considered to
be the supermost of all elderly personalities.

Parenthood

349

In the Srimad-Bhagavatam, Tenth Canto, 9th Chapter, 2nd verse,

Sukadeva Gosvami gives Maharaj Parlk�it a description of the form

and beauty of Mother Yasoda. He says, "My dear King, the wide hips

of Mother Yasoda were surrounded by silk and linen clothes, and her

breasts were flowing with milk because of her affection. When she
was churning butter and tightly holding the rope, the bangles on her

hands and the earrings on her ears were moving, and from the nice

decoration in her hair the flowers were slackening and falling down.
Due to her excessive labor, there were drops of perspiration on her

face."

There is another description of Mother Yasoda in a devotee's

prayer: "Let me be given protection by Mother Yasoda, whose curly

hairs are bound with thread, whose hair is very brightly beautified by

the vermilion placed in the part, and whose bodily frame derides all

her ornaments. Her eyes are always engaged in seeing the face of
Kr��a, and thus they are always filled with tears. She has a com­

plexion like the bluish lotus flower, which is enhanced in beauty by
her dressing herself with many colorful garments. Let her merciful

glance fall on all of us so that we may be protected from the clutches
of maya and smoothly progress in our devotional service!"

There is the following description of Mother Yasoda's affection for

Kr��a: After rising early in the morning, Mother Yasoda first of all

offered her breast milk to Kr��a, and then she began to chant various
mantras for His protection. Then she would decorate His forehead

very nicely and bind His arms with protective talismans. By all of

these activities, it is definitely understood that she is the emblem of
all maternal affection for Kr��a.

The description of Nanda Maharaj's bodily features is as follows.

The hairs on his head are generally black, but some of them are grey.
His garments are of greenish color, like the new -grown leaves of a

banyan tree. His belly is fatty, his complexion is exactly like the full

moon, and he has a beautiful moustache. When Krwa was a baby,

one day He was walking in the courtyard, capturing the finger of His

father, and because He could not walk steadily He appeared to be al­

most falling down. While Nanda Maharaj was giving protection to His

transcendental son in this way, all of a sudden there were drops of

350

The Nectar of Devotion

tears in his eyes, and he became overwhelmed with joy. Let us all
offer our respectful obeisances unto the lotus feet of King Nanda!
Childhood age, childish dress, movements by the child, sweet words
spoken by the child, nice smiling and various forms of childish play
are considered provocations for increasing the parental love for Kn;!la·
The childhood ages of Kr�!la are divided into three periods: the be­
ginning of kaumiira age, the middle of kaumiira age, and the end of
kaumiira age. During the beginning and middle of the kaumiira age,
Krwa's thighs are fatty, and the inner part of His eyes are whitish.
There are signs of teeth coming out, and He is very mild and gentle.
He is described as follows: "When Kr�!la had only three or four teeth
coming out of His gums, His thighs were fatty, His body was very,
very short, and He began to enhance the parental love of Nanda
Maharaj and Mother Yasoda with the activities of His childish body.
He was sometimes stepping with His legs again and again, sometimes
crying, sometimes smiling, sometimes sucking His thumb and some­
times lying down flat. These are some of the different activities of the
child Kr�!la. When Kr�!la was lying down flat, sometimes sucking the
toes of His feet, sometimes throwing His legs upwards, sometimes
crying and sometimes smiling, Mother Yasoda, seeing her son in such
pastimes, did not show any sign of restricting Him, but rather began
to watch her child with eagerness, enjoying these childhood pas­
times." In the beginning of Kr�!la's kaumiira age, there were the nails
of tigers set in a golden necklace about His neck. There was protective
tilaka on His forehead, black mascara around His eyes and silk thread
around His waist. These are the descriptions of Kr�!la's dress at the
beginning of the kaumiira age.
When Nanda Maharaj saw the beauty of child Kr�!la with tiger
nails on His chest, a complexion like the new-grown tiimala tree, beau­
tifully decorated tilaka made with cow's urine, arm decorations of
nice silk thread and silk clothes tied around His waist-when Nanda
Maharaj saw his child like this, he never became satiated by the child's
beauty.
In the middle kaumiira age, the upper portion of Krwa's hair falls
around His eyes. Sometimes He is covered with cloth around the
lower part of His body, and sometimes He is completely naked.

351

Parenthood

Sometimes He tries to walk, taking step by step, and sometimes He
talks very sweetly, in broken language. These were some of the symp­
toms of His middle kaumiira age. He is thus described when Mother
Y asoda once saw Him in His middle kaumiira age: His scattered hairs

were touching His eyebrows, and His eyes were restless, but He could
not express His feelings with proper words; still, when He was talking,
it was so nice and sweet to hear. When Mother Y asoda looked at His
little ears and saw Him naked, trying to run very quickly with His
little legs, she was merged into the ocean of nectar. Kr�!la's ornaments
at this age are a pearl hanging from the septum of His nose, butter on
His lotus-like palms and some small bells hanging from His waist. It is
stated that when Mother Y asoda saw that the child was moving, ring­
ing the bells on His waist, smiling at her with a pearl between His
nostrils and with butter on His hands, she became wonderfully
pleased to see her little child in that fashion.
While Kr�!la was in the middle of His kaumiira age, His waist be­
came thinner, His chest became broader, and His head was decorated
with His curly hairs, resembling the falling of the wings of a crow.
These wonderful features of Kr�!la's body never failed to astonish
Mother Y asoda. At the end of His kaumiira age, Kr�!la carried a small
stick in His hand, His clothing was a little longer, and He had a knot
around His waist, resembling the hood of a snake. In that dress He
used to take care of the calve� near the house, and sometimes He
played with cowherd boys of about the same age. He had a slender
flute and a buffalo horn bugle, and sometimes He played on a flute
made from the leaves of trees. These are some of the symptoms of the
end of Kr�!la's kaumiira age.
When Kr�!la was a little grown up and was taking care of the small
calves, He would often go near the forest. And when He was a little
bit late returning home, Nanda Maharaj would immediately get up on
the candrasiilikii

(a small shed built on the roof for getting a bird's

eye view all around), and he would watch for Him. Worrying about
the late arrival of his little son, Nanda Maharaj would remain on the
candrasiilikii

until he could indicate to his wife that Krsna, sur.

.

.

rounded by His little cowherd friends, was coming back with the
calves. Nanda Maharaj would point out the peacock feather on his

352

The Nectar of Devotion

child's head and would inform his beloved wife how the child was
pleasing his eyes.
Mother Yasoda then addressed Nanda Maharaj, "See my dear son,
whose eyes are white, who has a turban on His head, a wrapper on
His body and leg bells which tinkle very sweetly on His feet. He is
coming near, along with His surabhi calves, and just see how He is
wandering upon the sacred land of Vrndavana!"
Similarly, Maharaj Nanda addressed his wife, "My dear Yasoda,
just look at your offspring, Kr��a! See His blackish bodily luster, His
eyes tinged with red color, His broad chest and His nice golden neck­
lace! How wonderful He looks, and how He is increasing my tran­
scendental bliss more and more!"
When Kr��a, the beloved son of Nanda Maharaj, steps into His

kaisora age, although He becomes more beautiful, His parents still
consider Him as being in the paugaruJa age-even though He is be­
tween the ages of ten and fifteen. When Kr��a is in His paugar-fla age,
some of His servants also accept Him as being in the kaisora age.
When Kr��a performs His childish pastimes, His general practice is to
break the milk and yogurt pots, throw the yogurt in the courtyard
and steal the cream from the milk. Sometimes He breaks the churning
rod, and sometimes He throws butter on the fire. In this way, he in­
creases the transcendental pleasure of His Mother Y asoda.
In this connection Mother Yasoda once told Mukhara, her maid­
servant, "Just look at Kr��a looking stealthily toward all sides and
slowly stepping forward from the bushes. It appears that He is coming
just to steal the butter. Don't expose yourself or He may understand
that we are looking towards Him. I want to enjoy the sight of His
eyebrows moving in this cunning way, and I want to see His fearful
eyes and beautiful face."
In enjoying Krwa 's attitude of stealing butter very stealthily,
Mother Yasoda experienced the ecstasy of maternal love by smelling
His head, sometimes patting His body with her hand, sometimes
offering blessings, sometimes ordering Him, sometimes gazing at Him,
sometimes maintaining and sometimes giving Him good instructions
not to become a thief. Such activities are in maternal ecstatic love.
An important point to be observed in this connection is that the

Parenthood

353

childish propensity of stealing is there even in the Supreme Person­
ality of Godhead, and therefore this propensity is not artificial. How­
ever, in the spiritual relationship there is no inebriety to this stealing
propensity, as there is in the material world.

In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, Tenth Canto, 13th Chapter, verse 39,

S ukadeva Gosvami tells King Parik9it: "My dear King, as soon as the

elderly gopis saw their sons coming, there was an inexpressible sign of
parental love, and all of them became absorbed in affection. At first
they were planning to chastise their sons for stealing butter, but as

soon as the sons came before their eyes, they lost all of their angry
attitudes and became overwhelmed with affection. They began to
embrace their sons and smell their heads. While doing this, they be­
came almost mad after their children." In their childhood pastimes,

all these cowherd boys j oined with Kr��a in stealing butter. But
rather than become angry, Mother Yasoda became wet from the milk
flowing out of her breasts. Out of her affection for Kr��a, she began
to smell His head repeatedly.
The general activities of all the mothers of the cowherd boys were
to kiss them, to embrace them, to call them by their names and some­
times to mildly chastise them for their stealing habits. These mani­
festations of parental love are called siittvika ecstasy, wherein mani­

festations of eight kinds of ecstatic symptoms are visible in full. ln

the Srimad-Bhiigavatam,

Tenth

Canto, 13th Chapter,

19th verse,

S ukadeva Gosvami tells King Parik9it: "All the mothers of the cow­

herd boys were illusioned by the covering influence of the yoga-miiyii
potency of the Personality of Godhead, and as soon as they heard the
flute-playing of their boys, they immediately stood up and mentally
embraced their sons, who had been created by the direct internal
potency of Kr9�a. Accepting them as their born sons, they lifted
them into their arms and began to embrace them, resting the chil­
dren's bodies upon their own. The emotions created by this incident
were sweeter than nectar turned into a palatable intoxicant, and the
milk flowing out of their breasts was immediately drunk up by the
children."

In the Lalita-miidhava, compiled by Rii.pa Gosvami, Kr wa is ad­

dressed as follows: "My dear Kr9�a, when You are engaged in herding

354

The Nectar of Devotion

the animals, the dust caused by the hooves of the calves and cows
covers Your nice face and artistic tilaka, and You appear very dusty.
But when You return home, the milk flowing out of the breasts of

Your mother washes Your face of its dust covering, and it appears

that You are purified by this milk. It is just like when the Deity is

washed during the performance of the abhi§eka ceremony." It is the

custom in the temples of Deities that if there have been some impure

activities, the Deity has to be washed with milk. Kr��a is the Supreme

Personality of Godhead, and He was washed by the milk from the

breast of Mother Yasoda, which purified Him from the dust covering.

Sometimes there are examples of Mother Y asoda's becoming

stunned in ecstasy. This was exhibited when she saw her son lifting
Govardhan Hill. When Kr��a was standing, raising the hill, Mother
Yasoda hesitated to embrace Him and became stunned. The danger­

ous position that Kr��a had accepted by lifting the hill brought tears
to her eyes. And with her eyes filled with tears she could not see

Kr��a anymore, and because her throat was choked up by anxiety

she could not even instruct Kr��a as to what He should do in that
position. This is a symptom of becoming stunned in ecstatic love.

Mother Yasoda sometimes enjoyed transcendental ecstasy in hap­

piness when her child was saved from a dangerous situation, such
as being attacked by Piitana or some other demon. In Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, lOth Canto, 17th Chapter, 15th verse Sukadeva Go­

svami says that Mother Yasoda felt very, very fortunate when she got
back her lost child. She immediately placed Him on her lap and be­

gan to embrace Him again and again. While she was thus embracing

her son repeatedly, torrents of tears fell from her eyes, and she was

unable to express her transcendental joy. It is stated in the Vidagdha­

miidhava of Srila Riipa Gosvami: "My dear Kr��a, the touch of Your

mother is so pleasing and cooling that it surpasses the cooling capacity
of the pulp of sandalwood and of bright moonshine mixed with the

pulp of U§ira root." ( U§ira is a kind of root which when soaked with

water has a very, very cooling effect. It is especially used in the
scorching heat of the sun.)

The parental love of Mother Yasoda for Kr��a steadily increases,

and her love and ecstasy are sometimes described as intense affection

Parenthood

355

and sometimes as overwhelming attachment. An example of attach­
ment for Kr�l)a with overwhelming affection is given in the Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, Tenth Canto, 6th Chapter, 27th verse, where Sukadeva
Gosvaml addresses Maharaj Parik�it in this way: "My dear King,

when

magnanimous

Nanda

Maharaj

returned from

a tour,

he

began to smell the head of his son, and he was merged in the ecstasy

of parental love." A similar statement is there in connection with

Mother Yasoda when she was too anxious to hear the sound of

Kr�l)a's flute, expecting Him back from the pasturing ground. Be­

cause she thought that it was getting very late, her anxiety to hear
the sound of Kr�l)a's flute became doubled, and milk began to flow

out from her breast. In that condition she was sometimes going with­

in the house, sometim�s coming out of the house. She was constantly

looking to see if Govinda was coming back along the road. When
many very great sages were offering prayers to Lord Kr�l)a, glorifying
His activities, the Queen of Gokula, Mother Yasoda, entered the

battlefield of Kuruk�etra, wetting the lower part of her sari with the

milk flowing from her breast. This entrance of Mother Yasoda at

Kuruk�etra was not during the Battle of Kuruk�etra. At other times

Kr�l)a went to Kuruk�etra from His paternal home (Dvaraka) during

the solar eclipse, and at these times the residents of Vrndavana also
went to see Him there.

When Kr�l)a arrived at Kuruk�etra in pilgrimage, all the people as­
sembled there began to say that Kr�l)a the son of Devakl had arrived.

At that time Devakl, just like an affectionate mother, began to pat
Kr�l)a's face. And again when people cried that Kr�l)a, the son of

Vasudeva, had come, both King Nanda and Mother Yasoda became

overwhelmed with affection and expressed their great pleasure.

When Mother Yasoda, the Queen of Gokula, was going to see her

son Krwa at Kuruk�etra, one of her friends began to address her

thus: "My dear Queen, the milk flowing out of your breast-mountain
has already whitened the River Ganges, and the tears from your eyes,

mixed with black mascara, have already blackened the color of the

Yamuna. And as you are standing just between the two rivers, I think

there is no need for your anxiety to see your son's face. Your paren­
tal affection has already been exhibited to Him by these two rivers!"

356

The Nectar of Devotion

The same friend of Mother Yasoda addressed Kr�!la as follows:
"My dear Mukunda, if Mother Yasoda, the Queen of Gokula, is forced
to stand on fire, but is allowed to see Your lotus face, then this fire
will appear to her as the Himalayan Mountains: full of ice. In the
same way, if she is allowed to stay in the ocean of nectar, but is not
allowed to see the lotus face of Your Grace, then even this ocean of
nectar will appear to her as an ocean of arsenic poison." Let the

anxiety of Mother Yasoda of Braja, always expecting to see the lotus
face of Kr�!la, be glorified all over the universe!

A similar statement was given by Kuntidevi to Akriira: "My dear
brother Akriira, my nephew Mukunda is long absent from us. Will
you kindly tell Him that His Aunt Kunti is sitting amongst the enemy
and would like to know when she will be able to see His lotus face
again?"

In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, Tenth Canto, 46th Chapter, 2nd verse,

there is this statement: "When Uddhava was present at Vrndavana
and was narrating the activities of Kr�!la in Dvaraka, Mother Yasoda,
while hearing this narration, began to pour milk from her breasts and
shed tears from her eyes." Another incident demonstrating Yasoda's
extreme love for Kr�!la occurred when Kr�!la went to Mathura, the
kingdom of Kamsa. In separation from Kr�!la, Mother Y asoda was
looking at Kr�!la's makeup utensils, and she fell down on the ground
almost unconscious, with a great sound. When she was rolling over on
the ground, there were many scratches on her body, and in that

piteous condition she began to cry, "0 my dear son! My dear son!"
And she slapped her breasts with her two hands. This activity of
Mother Yasoda is explained by expert devotees as ecstatic love in
separation. Sometimes there are many other symptoms, such as great
anxiety, lamentation, frustration, being stunned, humility, restless­
ness, madness and illusion.
As far as Mother Yasoda's anxieties are concerned, when Kr�!la
was out of the house in the pasturing ground, a devotee once told
her, "Yasoda, I think your movements have been slackened, and I see
that you are full of anxieties. Your two eyes appear to be without
any movement, and I feel in your breathing a kind of warmth which
is bringing your breast milk to the boiling point. All these conditions
prove that out of separation from your son you have a severe head-

Parenthood

357

ache." These are some of the symptoms of Mother Yasoda's anxiety
for Kr��a.
When Akrilra was present in V rndavana and was narrating the activi­
ties of Krsna in Dvaraka, Mother Yasoda was informed that Krsna
.

. .

.

.

.

had married so many queens and was very busy there in His householder affairs. Hearing this, Mother Yasoda lamented how unfortu­
nate she was that she could not get her son married just after passing
His kaisora age, and thus she could not receive both her son and
daughter-in-law at her home. She exclaimed, "My dear Akrilra, you
are simply throwing thunderbolts on my head!" These are the signs
of lamentation on the part of Mother Yasoda in separation from
Kr��a.
Similarly, Mother Yasoda felt frustration when she thought, "Al­
though I have millions of cows, the milk of these cows could not
satisfy Kr��a. Therefore let a curse be on this milk! And I also am
condemned because although I am so opulent in material prosperity,
I am now unable to smell the head of my child and feed Him with
my breast milk as I used to do when He was here in Vrndavana."
This is a sign of frustration on the part of Mother Yasoda in separa­
tion from Krwa.
One friend of Kr��a's addressed Him thus: "My dear lotus-eyed
one, when You were living in Gokula You were always bearing a stick
in Your hand. That stick is now lying idle in the house of Mother
Yasoda, and whenever she sees it she becomes motionless just like
the stick." This is the sign of becoming stunned in separation from
Kr��a. In separation from Krwa Mother Yasoda became so humble
that she prayed to the creator of the universe, Lord Brahma, with
tears in her eyes: "My dear creator, won't you kindly bring my dear
son Kr��a back to me so that I can see Him at least for a moment?"
Sometimes in restlessness like a madwoman Mother Yasoda used to
accuse Nanda Maharaj, "What are you doing in the palace? You shame­
less man! Why do people call you the King of Braja? It is very aston­
ishing that while being separated from your dear son Kr��a, you are
still living within Vrndavana as a hard-hearted father!"
Someone informed Kr��a about the madness of Mother Yasoda
in the following words: "In madness Mother Yasoda has addressed
the kadamba trees and inquired from them, 'Where is my son?' Simi-

_,

358

The Nectar of Devotion

larly, she has addressed the birds and the drones and inquired from
them as to whether Kr�!la has passed before them, and she has in­
quired if they can say anything about You. In this way, Mother
Yasoda in illusion was asking everybody about You, and she has been
wandering all over Vrndavana." This is madness in separation from
Kr�!la.
When Nanda Maharaj was accused by Mother Y asoda of being
"hard-hearted," he replied, "My dear Yasoda, why are you becoming
so agitated? Kindly look more carefully. Just see, your son Kr�!la is
standing before you! Don't become a madwoman like this. Please
keep my home peaceful." And Kr�!la was informed by some friend
that His father Nanda was also in illusion in this way, in separation
from Him.
When all the wives of Vasudeva were present in the arena of
Kamsa, they saw the most pleasing bodily features of Kr�!la, and im­
mediately, out of parental affection, milk began to flow from their
breasts, and the lower parts of their saris became wet. This symptom
of ecstatic love is an example of the result of fulfillment of desire.

In the First Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, llth Chapter, 25th

verse, it is stated, "When Kr�!la entered Dvaraka after finishing the
Battle of Kuruk�etra, He first of all saw His mother and all His dif­
ferent stepmothers and offered His respectful obeisances unto their
feet. The mothers immediately took Kr�!la upon their laps, and be­
cause of their parental affection, there was milk flowing out of their
breasts. So their breast milk, mixed with the water of tears, became
the first offering to Kr�!la. This is one of the examples of being satis­
fied after a great separation.

There is a similar statement in the Lalita-miidhava: "How wonder­

ful it is that Yasoda, the wife of King Nanda, out of her parental af­
fection for Kr�!la, mixed her tears and the milk from her breasts and

thus bathed her dear son Krwa." In Vidagdha-miidhava, a devotee

addresses Lord Kr�!la as follows: "My dear Mukunda, just after seeing
Your face full with the flavor of the lotus flower, and being attracted
by the moonlight of Your face, Mother Yasoda became so overjoyed
in her affection that immediately from the nipples of her waterpot­
like breasts, milk began to flow." She was thus constantly engaged in
supplying milk to Kr�!la after wetting the covering cloth over the jug.

Parenthood

359

These are some of the signs of parental love for Kr��a by His

mother, father and elderly persons. Symptoms of ecstatic love in

parental affection are expressed when Krwa is accepted as the son.

These constant transcendental emotions for Kr��a are called steady

ecstasy in parental love.

Srila Rupa Gosvam'i states herein that according to some learned

scholars, the three kinds of transcendental mellow so far described­

namely, servitude, fraternity and parental affection-are sometimes

mixed up. For example, the fraternal feelings of Balarama are mixed

with servitude and parental affection. Similarly, King Yudhi�thira's
attraction for Kr��a is also mixed with parental affection and servi­
tude.

Similarly, the transcendental mellow of Ugrasena, Kr��a's

grandfather, is mixed with servitude and parental affection. The af­

fection of all the elderly gopis in Vrndavana is a mixture of parental

love, servitude and fraternity. The affection of the sons of Madr'i,

Nakula and Sahadeva, as well as the affection of sage Narada, is a

mixture of friendship and servitude. The affection of Lord Siva,
Garu?a and Uddhava is a mixture of servitude and fraternity.

44 I Devotional Service
in Conj ugal Love

A pure devotee's attraction to Kr�l!a in conjugal love is called de­

votional service in conjugal love. Although such conjugal feelings are

not at all material, there is some similarity between this spiritual love

and material activities. Therefore, persons who are interested only in

material activities are unable to understand this spiritual conjugal

love, and these devotional reciprocations appear very mysterious to

them. Riipa Gosvami therefore describes conjugal love very briefly.

The impetuses of conjugal love are Kr�l!a and His very dear con­

sorts, such as Radhariit;1i and Her immediate associates. Lord Kr�l!a

has no rival: no one is equal to Him, and no one is greater than Him.

His beauty is also without any rival, and because He excels all others
in the pastimes of conjugal love, He is the original object of all con­

jugal love.

In the Gita-govinda by J ayadeva Gosvami one gopi tells her friend:

"Kr�l!a is the reservoir of all pleasure within this universe. His body is

as soft as the lotus flower. And His free behavior with the gopis,
which appears exactly like a young boy's attraction to a young girl,

is a subject matter of transcendental eonjugal love." A pure devotee

follows in the footsteps of the

gopis and worships the gopis as fol­

lows: "Let me offer my respectful obeisances to all the young cow­

herd girls, whose bodily features are so attractive. Simply by their
beautiful attractive features they are worshiping the Supreme Per­

sonality of Godhead, Krwa." Out of all the young gopis, Srimati
RadhariiJ!i is the most prominent.

The beauty of Srimati Radhariit;1i is described as follows: "Her eyes

defeat the attractive features of the eyes of the cakori bird. When
360

Devotional Service in Conjugal Love

361

one sees the face of Radhara�i, he immediately hates the beauty of

the moon. Her bodily complexion defeats the beauty of gold. Thus,

let us all look upon the transcendental beauty of Srimati Radhara�i"
Kr��a's attraction for Radhara�i is described by Kr��a Himself thus:

"When I create some joking phrases in order to enjoy the beauty of

Radhara�i, Radhara�i hears these joking words with great attention;

but by Her bodily features and counter words She neglects Me. And
I even possess unlimited pleasure by Her neglect of Me, for She be­

comes so beautiful that She increases My pleasure one hundred

times." A similar statement can be found in Gita-govinda, wherein it

is said that when the enemy of Kamsa, Sri Krwa, embraces Srimati
Radhara�i, He immediately becomes entangled in a loving condition

and gives up the company of all other gopis.

In the Padyiivali of Riipa Gosvami it is stated that when the gopis

hear the sound of Kr��a 's flute, they immediately forget all rebukes

offered by the elderly members of their families, their defamation

and the harsh behavior of their husbands. Their only thought is to go

out in search of Kr��a. When the gopis meet Kr��a, the display of

their exchanging glances as well as their joking and laughing behavior

is called anubhiiva, or sub-ecstasy in conjugal love.

In the Lalita-miidhava, Riipa Gosvami explains that the movements

of Krwa 's eyebrows are just like the Yamuna, and the smiling of
Radhara�i is just like the moonshine. When the Yamuna and the

moonshine come in contact on the bank of the river, the water tastes
just like nectar, and drinking it gives great satisfaction. It is as cooling

as piles of snow. Similarly, in the Padyiivali, one constant companion

of Radhara�i says, "My dear moon-faced Radhara�i, Your whole

body appears to be very content, yet there are signs of tears in Your
eyes. Your speech is faltering, and Your chest is also heaving. By all

these signs I can understand that You must have heard the blowing of
Kr��a's flute, and, as a result of this, Your heart is now melting."

In the same Padyiivali there is the following description, which is

taken as a sign of frustration in conjugal love. Srimati Radhara�i said,

"Dear Mr. Cupid, please do not excite Me by throwing your arrows

at My body. Dear Mr. Air, please do not arouse Me with the fragrance

of flowers. I am now bereft of Kr��a 's loving attitude, so under the

11
362

The Nectar of Devotion

circumstances, what is the use of My sustaining this useless b0'1
dy?

There is no need for such a body by any living entity." This is a sign
of frustration in ecstatic love for Krsna.

: Srimatl Radharapl, I uinting to

Kr�pa, says, "This clever boy of the forest has the be;"

�< the universe.

Now after giving Me a taste of His transcendental body, He has en­

thused Me, and it is more than I can tolerate. I am now feeling like a

female elephant who has been enthused by a male elephant!" This is

an instance of jubilation in ecstatic love with Kr�pa.

Steady ecstasy of conjugal love is the original cause of bodily en­

joyment. In the Padyiivalf this original cause of union is described

when Radharapl tells one of Her constant companions: "My dear
friend, who is this boy whose eyelids, dancing constantly, have in­

creased the beauty of His face and attracted My desire for conjugal

love? His ears are decorated with the buds of asoka flowers, and He

has dressed Himself in yellow robes. By the sound of His flute, this
boy has already made Me impatient."

The conjugal love of Radha-Kr�pa is never disturbed by any per­

sonal consideration. The undisturbed nature o � the conjugal love be­

tween Radha and Kr�pa is described thus: "Just a little distance away
from Kr�pa was Mother Y asoda, and Kr�pa 'Vas surrounded by all of

His friends. In front of His eyes there w;,.,; Candravall, and, at the

same time, on a chunk of stone in front of the entrance to Braja,

r[

there was standing the demon known as V r�asura. But even in such

circumstances, when Kr�pa saw Radharap�- standing just bel. 1d a

bush of many creepers, immediately His beautiful eyebrows moved

just like lightning towards Her."

Another instance is described as follows: "On one side of the
courtyard the dead body of Sankhasura was lying, surrounded by

many jackals. On another side were many learned briihmaras who

were all self-controlled. They were offering nice prayers, which were

as soothing as the cool breeze in summer. In front of Kr�pa, Lord

Baladeva was standing, causing a cooling effect. But even amidst all

these different circumstances of soothing and disturbing effects, the

lotus flower of ecstatic conjugal love that Kr�pa felt for Radharapl

�----

Devoiional Service in Conjugal Love

363

could not wither." This love of Krwa for Radhara�i is often com­

pared to a blooming lotus: the only difference is that Kr��a's love re­
mains ever-increasingly beautiful.

Conjugal love is divided into two portions: vipralambha, or con­
jugal love in separation, and sambhoga, or conjugal love in direct con­

tact. Vipralambha, separation, has three sub-divisions known as

l)

piirva-raga, or preliminary attraction, 2) mana, or seeming anger, and
3) pravasa, or separation by distance.

When the lover and the beloved have a distinct feeling of not

meeting each other, that stage is called piirva-riiga, or preliminary at­

traction. In Padyavali Radhara�i told Her companion, "My dear
friend, I was just going to the bank of the Yamuna, and all of a sud­
den a very nice boy whose complexion is like a dark blue cloud be­

came visible in front of My eyes. He glanced over Me in a way that I
cannot describe. But since this has occured, I am sorry that I can
no longer engage My mind in the duties of My household affairs."
This is an instance of preliminary attraction for Krwa. In Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, Tenth Canto, 53rd Chapter, verse 2, Krwa told the mes­

senger brahmal)a who came from Rukmi�i: "My dear brahmal)a, just

like Rukmi�i I cannot sleep at night, and My mind is always fixed on

her. I know that her brother Rukmi is against Me, and due to his
persuasion, My marriage with her has been cancelled." This is another
instance of preliminary attraction.

As far as mana, or anger, is concerned, there is the following inci­

dent described in Gita-govinda: "When Srimati Radharapi saw Kr��a

enjoying Himself in the company of several other gopis, She became

a little jealous because Her special prestige was being dimmed. There-·
fore, She immediately left the scene and took shelter in a nice flower

bush where the black drones were humming. Then, hiding Herself be­

hind the creepers, She began to express Her sorrow to one of Her
consorts." This is an instance of a seeming disagreement.

An example of pravasa, or being out of contact because of living in

a distant place, is given in the Padyavali as follows: "Since the aus­

picious day when Kr��a left for Mathura, Srimati Radhara�i has been
pressing Her head on one of Her hands and constantly shedding tears.
Her face is always wet now, and therefore there is no chance of Her

364

The Nectar of Devotion

sleeping even for a moment." When the face becomes wet, the sleep­

ing tendency is immediately removed. So when Radhara!li was always

weeping for Kr9!la because of His separation, there was no chance of
Her getting any sleep for Herself. In the Prahliida-sarhhitii Uddhava

says, "The Supreme Personality of Godhead, Govinda, painstricken

due to being pierced by the arrows of Cupid, is always thinking of

you [the gopis] , and He is not even accepting His regular lunch. Nor

is He getting any proper rest."

When the lover and beloved come together and enjoy one another

by direct contact, this stage is called sambhoga. There is a statement

in Padyiivali as follows: "Kr9!1a embraced Srimati Radhara!li in such
an expert manner that He appeared to be celebrating the dancing
ceremony of the peacocks."

Sri Rupa Gosvami thus ends the fifth wave of his Ocean of the

Nectar of Devotion. He offers his respectful obeisances to the Su­

preme Personality of Godhead who appeared as Gopala, the eternal
form of the Lord.
Thus ends the Bhaktivedanta summary study of the third division
of Bhakti-rasamrta-sindhu in the matter of the five primary relation­
ships with K[§"[la.

45 I Laughing Ecstasy

In the fourth division of Bhakti-rasiimrta-sindhu, Srila Riipa Go­
svami has described seven kinds of indirect ecstasies of devotional
service-known as laughing, astonishment, chivalry, compassion, an­

ger, dread and ghastliness. In this portion, S rila Riipa Gosvami fur­

ther describes these ecstasies of devotional feelings, some being com­
patible and others incompatible with one another. When one kind of
ecstatic devotional service overlaps with another in a conflicting way,
this state of affairs is called rasiibhiisa, or perverted presentation of
mellows.
Expert

learned scholars

say that laughing is generally found

amongst youngsters or in the combination of old persons and young
children. This ecstatic loving laughing is sometimes also found in per­
sons who are very grave by nature. Once an old mendicant ap­
proached the door of Mother Yasoda's house, and Kr�!la told Yasoda,
"My dear Mother, I don't wish to go near this skinny villain. If I go
there, he might put Me within his begging bag and take Me away
from You!" In this way, the wonderful child, Kr�!J-a, began to look at
His mother, while the mendicant, who was standing in the door, tried
to hide his smiling face, although he could not do so. He immediately
expressed his smiling. In this instance, Kr�!la Himself is the object of
laughing affairs.
Once one of Kr�t!a's friends informed Him, "My dear :Kf§l!J-a, if
You will open Your mouth, then I shall give You one nice sugar can­
dy mixed with yogurt." Kr9t!a immediately opened His mouth, but
instead of giving Him sugar candy with yogurt, the friend dropped a
flower in His mouth. After tasting this flower, :Kf§'tla turned His
365

366

Laughing Ecstasy

mouth in a disfigured way, and upon seeing this all His friends stand­
ing there began to laugh very loudly.

Once a palmist came to the house of Nanda Maharaj, and Nanda

Maharaj asked him, "My dear sage, will you kindly check the hand of
my child, Kr�l)a? Tell me how many years He will live and whether
He will become the master of thousands of cows." Upon hearing this,

the palmist began to smile, and Nanda Maharaj asked him, "My dear
sir, why are you laughing, and why are you covering your face?"

In such a laughing ecstasy of love, Kr�'!a or matters pertaining to

Kr�'!a are the cause of the laughter. In such laughing devotional ser­

vice, there are symptoms of jubilation, laziness, concealed feelings and

similar other seemingly disturbing elements.

According to Srila Riipa Gosvam'i's calculation, laughter in ecstatic

love can be broken down into six divisions. These divisions, according

to different degrees of smiling, are call1

in the Sanskrit language

smita, hasita, vihasita, avahasita, apaha:>ita, and atihasita. These six
classes of smiling can be classified a� major and minor. The major

division includes smita, hasita and vilwsita smiling, and the minor
division includes avahasita, apahasita ;1nd atihasita smiling.

When one is smiling but his teeth are not visible, one can distinctly

mark a definite change in the eyes and in the cheeks. This is called

smita smiling. Once when Kr�ra was stealing yogurt, J arat'i, the head­
mistress of the house, could detect His activities, and she was there­

fore coming very hurriedly to catch Him. At that time, Kr�'!a became

very much afraid of Jarat'i and went to His elder brother Baladeva.

He said, "My dear brother, I have stolen yogurt! Just see-J arat'i is

coming hurriedly to catch Me!" When Kr�l)a was thus seeking the

shelter of Baladeva because He was being chased by J arat!, all the
great sages in the heavenly planets began to smile. This smiling is
called smita smiling.

Smiling in which the teeth are slightly visible is called hasita

smiling. One day Abhimanyu, the so-called husband of Radhariil)1,

was returning home, and at that time he could not see that Kr�l)a was
there in his house. Kr�l)a immediately changed His dress to look ex­

actly like Abhimanyu and approached Abhimanyu's mother, Jatila,
addressing her thus: "My dear Mother, I am your real son Abhimanyu,

but just see-Kr�l)a, dressed up like me, is coming before you!"

367

The Nectar of Devotion

Jatila, the mother of Abhimanyu, immediately believed that Krwa
was her own son and thus became very angry at her real son who
was coming home. She began to drive away her real son, who was
crying, "Mother! Mother! What are you doing?" Seeing this incident,
all the girl friends of Radhara�1, who were present there, began to
smile, and a portion of their teeth was visible. This is an instance of
hasita smiling.

When the teeth are distinctly visible in a smile, that is called vi­
hasita. One day when Kr��a was engaged in stealing butter and yo·

gurt in the house of Jatila, He assured His friends, "My dear friends,
I know that this old lady is now sleeping very profoundly because
she is breathing very deeply. Let us silently steal butter and yogurt
without making any disturbance." But the old lady, Jatila, was not
sleeping; so she could not contain her smiling, and her teeth im­
mediately became distinctly visible. This is an instance of vihasita
smiling.
In a state of smiling, when the nose becomes puffed and the eyes
squint, the smiling is called avahasita. Once, early in the morning
when Krwa returned home after performing His riisa dance, Mother
Yasoda looked upon Kr��a's face and addressed Him thus: "My dear
son, why do Your eyes look like they have been smeared with some
oxides? Have You dressed Yourself with the blue garments of Bala­
deva?" When Mother Yasoda was addressing Krwa in that way, a
girl friend who was nearby began to smile with a puffed nose and
squinting eyes. This is an instance of avahasita smiling. The gopi
knew that Kr��a had been enjoying the riisa dance and that Mother
Yasoda could not detect her son's activities nor understand how He
had become covered with the gopis' makeup. Her smiling was in the
avahasita feature.
When tears from the eyes are added to the smiling, and the shoul­

ders are shaking, the smile is called apahasita. When child Kr��a was
dancing in response to the singing of the old maidservant J arat1,
Narada was astonished. The Supreme Personality of Godhead, who
controls all the movements of great demigods like Brahma and
others, was now dancing to the indications of an old maidservant.
Seeing this fun, Narada also began to dance, and his shoulders

'-

Laughing Ecstasy

368

trembled, and his eyes moved. Due to his smiling, his teeth also be­
came visible, and on account of the glaring effulgence from his teeth,
the clouds in the skies turned silver.
When a smiling person claps his hands and leaps in the air, the
smiling expression changes into atihasita, or overwhelming laughter.
An example of atihasita was manifested in the following incident:
Krwa once addressed Jarat1 thus: "My dear good woman, the skin (}f
your face is now slackened, and so your face exactly resembles a
monkey's. As such, the King of the monkeys, Bal1mukha, has selected
you as his worthy wife." While Kr�!la was teasing Jarat1 in this way,
she replied that she was certainly aware of the fact that the King of
the monkeys was trying to marry her, but she had already taken
shelter of Krwa, the killer of many powerful demons, and therefore
she had already decided to marry Krwa instead of the King of the
monkeys. On hearing this sarcastic reply by the talkative Jarat1, all
the cowherd girls present there began to laugh very loudly and clap
their hands. This laughter, accompanied by the clapping of hands, is
called atihasita.
Sometimes there are indirect sarcastic remarks which also create
atihasita circumstances. An example of one such remark was made

by one of the cowherd girls to KutiHi, the daughter of JatiHi and sis­
ter of Abhimanyu, the so-called husband of Radhara!\1. Indirectly
Kutila was insulted by the following statement: "My dear Kutila,
daughter of Jatila, your breasts are as long as string beans-simply dry
and long. Your nose is so gorgeous that it is defying the beauty of the
noses of frogs. And your eyes are more beautiful than the eyes of
dogs. Your lips are defying the flaming cinders of fire, and your ab­
domen is as beautiful as a big drum. Therefore, my dear beautiful
Kutila, you are the most beautiful of all the cowherd girls of Vrnda­
vana, and because of your extraordinary beauty, I think you must be
beyond the attraction of the sweet blowing of Kr9!1a's flute!"

46 I Astonishment and Chivalry

Astonishment
The ecstasy of astonishment in devotional service is perceived in
two ways: directly, by the experience of one's own eyes, and indi­
rectly, by hearing from others.
When Narada came to see the activities of the Lord at Dvaraka,
and he saw that :Kfgta was present within every palace in the same
body and was engaged in different activities, he was struck with won­
der. This is one of the examples of astonishment in devotional service
by direct perception. One of the friends of Mother Y asoda says,
"Yasoda, j ust see the fun! On the one hand, there is your child who
is always captivated by sucking the milk from your breast, and on the
other hand there is the great Govardhan Hill which can ob::>tll lCt the
passing of the clouds. But still, j ust see how wonderful it is that this
great Govardhan Hill is resting on the finger of your child's left hand,

j ust as though it were a toy. Is this not very mysterious?" This state­
ment is another example of astonishment in devotional service by di­
rect perception.
An instance of astonishment in devotional service by indirect per­
ception occurred when Maharaj Parik�it heard from S ukadeva Go­
svami about Kr�!la's killing Narakiisura, who had been fighting Kr�!la
with eleven divisions of ak§auhiri soldiers. Each division of ak§auhiTy,i
soldiers contained several thousand elephants, several thousand horses
and chariots, and several hundreds of thousands of infantry soldiers.
Narakiisura possessed eleven such divisions, and all of them were

369

Astonishment and Chivalry

370

throwing arrows toward Krwa, but Kn;�a killed them all, simply by
throwing three arrows from His side. When Maharaj Parik�it heard of
this wonderful victory, he immediately rubbed the tears from his
eyes and became overwhelmed with joy. This instance is an example
of astonishment in devotional service by indirect perception through
aural reception.
There is another example of indirect astonishment. Trying to test
Kr��a to see if He were truly the Supreme Personality of Godhead,
Lord Brahma stole all the cowherd boys and cows from Him. But
after a few seconds, he saw that Kr��a was still present with all the
cows, calves and cowherd boys, exactly in the same way as before.
When Lord Brahma described this incident to his associates on the
Satya-loka planet, they all became astonished. Brahma told them
that after taking away all the boys, he saw Kr��a again playing with
the same boys in the same fashion. Their bodily complexion was
blackish, almost like Kr��a's, and they all had four arms. The same
calves and cows were still present there, in the same original fashion.
Even while describing this incident, Brahma became almost over­
whelmed. "And the most astonishing thing," he added, "was that
many other Brahmas from many different universes had also come
there to worship Kr��a and His associates."
Similarly, when there was a forest fire in the Bha��iravana, Kr��a
instructed His friends to close their eyes tightly, and they all did this.
Then when Kr��a had extinguished the fire, the cowherd boys opened
their eyes and saw that they had been relieved from the danger and
that their cows and calves were all safe. They began to perceive the
wonder of the situation simply by guessing how Kr��a had saved
them. This is another instance of indirect perception causing aston­
ishment in devotional service.
The activities of a person, even if they are not very extraordinary,
create an impression of wonder in the heart and mind of the person's
friends. But even very wonderful activities performed by a person
who is not one's friend will not create any impression. It is because
of love that one's wonderful activities create an impression in the
mind.

The Nectar of Devotion

Chivalry
When on account of love and devotional service for the Lord there
is special valorous enthusiasm, the resultant activities are called chiv­

alrous. These chivalrous activities can be manifested in the acts of

mock-fighting, giving in charity, showing mercy and executing reli­

gious principles. By performing chivalrous activities in fighting, one is
called yuddha-vira. By charitable activities one is called diina-vira. By
showing extraordinary mercy one is called dayii-vira. And when one
is munificent in executing religious rites, he is called dharma-vira. In

all such different chivalrous activities, Krwa is the object.

When a friend wants to satisfy Kr�rta by performing some chival­

rous activities, the friend becomes the challenger, and Kr�rta Himself

becomes the opponent; or else Kr�rta may give audience to the fight­

ing, and by His desire another friend becomes the opponent. A friend
once challenged Kr�rta thus: "My dear Madhava, You are very restless

because You think that no one can defeat You. But if You do not

flee from here, then I shall show You how I can defeat You. And my

friends will be very satisfied to see this!."

Kr�rta and Sridama were very intimate friends, yet Sridama, out of
anger with Kr�rta, challenged Him. When both of them began to fight,

all the friends on the bank of the Yamuna enjoyed the wonderful
fighting of the two friends. They prepared some arrows for mock­

fighting, and Kr�rta began to throw his arrows at Sridama. Sridama

began to block these arrows by whirling his pole, and by Sridama's

chivalrous activities, Kr�rta became very satisfied. Such mock-fighting

generally takes place amongst chivalrous persons and creates wonder­
ful excitement for all viewers.

There is a statement in the Hari-varhsa that sometimes Arjuna and

Krwa fought in the presence of Kunti, and Arjuna would be defeated

by Kr�rta.
In such chivalrous fighting between friends, there is sometimes

bragging, self-complacence, pride, power, taking to weapons, chal­
lenging and standing as opponent. All of these symptoms become
impetuses to chivalrous devotional service.
One friend challenged Kr�rta thus: "My dear friend Damodara, You

Astonishment and Chivalry

372

are an expert only in eating. You have defeated Subala only because

he is weak and You adopted cheating means. Don't advertise Yourself

to be a great fighter by such action. You have advertised Yourself as a

serpent, and I am the peacock who will now defeat You." The pea­
cock is the ablest enemy of the serpent.

In such fighting between friends, when the self-advertisement be­

comes personal, learned scholars say it is sub-ecstasy. When there is a
roaring challenge, certain kinds of movement for fighting, enthusiasm,

no weapons and assurance given to frightened witnesses-all these

chivalrous activities are called sub-ecstasy.

One friend addressed Kr�!la in this 1manner: "My dear Madhu­

siidana, You know my strength, yet You are encouraging Bhadrasena,

and not me, to challenge mighty Baladeva. By this action You are

simply insulting me because my arms are as strong as the bolts of the

gate!"

A devotee once said, "My dear Lord Kr$!!a, may Your challenger,

Sr'idama, become glorious for his chivalrous activities, such as vibrat­

ing like a thunder cloud and roaring like a lion. May all glories go to
Sridama's chivalrous activities!" Chivalrous activities in the matter of

fighting, charity, mercy and execution of religious rituals are called

constitutional; whereas the expression of pride, emotions, endurance,
kindness, determination, jubilation, enthusiasm, jealousy and remem­

brance are called unconstitutional. When Stokakf${la, one of the many
friends of Kf�{la, was fighting with Him, his father chastised him for
fighting with Kr${la, who was the life and soul of all residents of

Vrndavana. Upon hearing these chastisements, Stokakr$!1a stopped

his fighting. But Krwa continued to challenge him, and thus, in order

to meet the challenge, Stokakr$!la took his pole and began to display
his dexterity by whirling it.

Once Sridama challenged Bhadrasena and said to him, "My dear

friend, you needn't be afraid of me yet. I shall first of all defeat

our brother Balarama, then I shall beat Kr$!!a, and then I shall come
to you." Bhadrasena therefore left the party of Balarama and joined
Kr$!!a, and he agitated his friends as much as the Mandara Hill had
agitated the whole ocean. By his roaring sounds he deafened all his
friends, and he enthused Kr$!la with his chivalrous activities.

373

The Nectar of Devotion

Once Kn;�a challenged all His friends and said, "My dear friends,
just see-I am jumping with great chivalrous prowess. Please do
not flee away." Upon hearing these challenging words, another
friend named V ariithapa counter-challenged the Lord and struggled
against Him.
One of the friends once remarked, "Sudama is trying his best to see
Damodara defeated, and I think that if our powerful Subala joins
him, they will be a very beautiful combination, like a valuable jewel
bedecked with gold."
In these chivalrous activities, only Kr��a's friends can be the op­
ponents. Kr��a's enemies can never actually be His opponents. There­
fore, this challenging by Kr��a's friends is called devotional service in
chivalrous activities.
Diina-vira, or chivalry in the giving in charity, can be divided into
two parts: munificence and renunciation. A person who can sacrifice
everything for the satisfaction of Kr��a is called munificent. When a
person desires to make a sacrifice because of his seeing Kr��a, Kr�rm
is called the impetus of the munificent activity. When Kr��a appeared
as the son of Nanda Maharaj, in clear consciousness Nanda Maharaj
desired all auspiciousness for his son and thus began to give in charity
valuable cows to all the briihmarws. The briihmaflaS were so satisfied
by this charitable action that they were obliged to say that the chari­
ty of N anda Maharaj had excelled the charity of such past kings as
Maharaj Prthu and Nrga.
When a person knows the glories of the Lord completely and is
prepared to sacrifice everything for the Lord, he is called sampra­
diinaka, or one who gives everything in charity for the sake of Krwa.
When Maharaj Yudhi�thira went with Kr��a in the arena of the
riija-silya sacrifice, in his imagination he began to anoint the body of
Kr��a with pulp of sandalwood, he decorated Him with a garland
hanging down to His knees, he began to give Him garments all em­
broidered with gold, he gave Him ornaments all bedecked with valu­
able jewels, and he gave Him many fully decorated elephants, chariots
and horses. He further wished to give Krwa in charity his kingdom,
his family and his personal self also. After so desiring, when there was
nothing to actually give in charity, Maharaj Yudhi�thira became very
perturbed and anxious.

Astonishment and Chivalry

374

Similarly, Maharaj Bali once told his priest, Sukracarya: "My dear

sage, you are fully expert in knowledge of the Vedas, and as such you
worship the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Vi�l).U, by Vedic ritu­
als. As far as this briihmar-a dwarf [the incarnation Vamanadeva]

is concerned, if He is Lord Vi�l).U, a simple briihmar-a, or even my

enemy, I have decided to give to Him in charity all the land He has

asked for." Maharaj Bali was so fortunate that the Lord extended be­

fore Him His hand, which was reddish from touching the breast of

the goddess of fortune, who is always smeared with red kunkum
powder. In other words, although the Personality of Godhead is so
great that the goddess of fortune is always under His command for
enjoyment, He still extended His hands to take charity from Maharaj
Bali.

A person who wants to give everything in charity to Krwa but does

not want anything in return is considered the real renouncer. Thus, a
devotee will refuse to accept any kind of liberation, even if it is of­

fered by the Lord. Real love of Kr�l}a becomes manifested when

Kr�l}a becomes the recipient of charity and the devotee becomes the

g�ver.

In the Hari-bhakti-sudhodaya there is another example, forwarded

by Maharaj Dhruva. He says there, "My dear Lord, I have practiced

austerities and penances because I was desiring to receive something

from You, but in exchange You have allowed me to see You, who are
never visible even to the great sages and saintly persons. I had been

searching out some pieces of broken glass, but instead I have found

the most valuable jewel. I am therefore fully satisfied, my Lord. I do
not wish to ask anything more from Your Lordship."

A similar statement is to be found in the Third Canto of Srimad­

Bhiigavatam, 15th Chapter, 48th verse. The four sages headed by
Sanaka Muni addressed the Lord as follows: "My dear Supreme Per­

sonality of Godhead, Your reputation is very attractive and free from
all material contamination. Therefore You are worthy of being glori­
fied and are actually the reservoir of all pilgrimages. Auspicious per­

sons, who are fortunate enough to be engaged in glorifying Your
attributes and who actually know what Your transcendental position

is, do not even care to accept liberation offered by You. Because they

are so transcendentally enriched, they do not care to accept even the

375

The Nectar ofDevotion

post of Indra, the heavenly King. They know that the post of the

King of heaven is also fearful, whereas for those who are engaged in

glorifying Your transcendental qualities there is only joyfulness and

freedom from all danger. As such, why should persons with this

knowledge be attracted by a post in the heavenly kingdom?"

One devotee has described his feelings about the charity exhibited

by King Mayiiradhvaja: "I am faltering even to speak about the

activities of Maharaj Mayiiradhvaja, to whom I offer my respectful

obeisances." Mayiiradhvaja was very intelligent, and he could under­

stand why Kr�!la came to him once, in the garb of a briihmar-a. Kr�!la

demanded from him half of his body, to be sawed off by his wife and

son, and King Mayiiradhvaja agreed to this proposal. On account of

his intense feeling of devotional service, King Mayiiradhvaja was

always thinking of Kr�!J.a, and when he understood that Krwa had

come in the garb of a briihmar-a, he did not hesitate to part with half

of his body. This sacrifice of Maharaj Mayiiradhvaja for Kr�!!a's sake

is unique in the world, and we should offer our all-respectful obei­

sances to him. He had full knowledge of the Supreme Personality of
Godhead in the garb of a briihmar-a, and he is known as the perfect

diina-vira, or renouncer.

Any person who is always ready to satisfy Kr�!la and who is always

\I

dexterous in executing devotional service is called dharma-vira, or
chivalrous in executing religious rituals. Only advanced devotees per­

forming religious ritualistic performances can come to this stage of
dharma-vira. Dharma-viras are produced after going through the au­

thoritative scriptures, following moral principles, being faithful and

tolerant and controlling the senses. Persons who execute religious
rituals for the satisfaction of Kr�!ia are steady in devotional service,

whereas persons who execute religious rituals without intending to
please Kr�!ia are only called pious.

The best example of a dharma-vira is Maharaj Yudhi�thira. A devo­

tee once told Kr�!J.a: "My dear Kr�!J.a, 0 killer of all demons, Maharaj

Yudhi�thira, the eldest son of Maharaj Pa!l-9-u, has performed all kinds

of sacrifices just to please You. He has always invited the heavenly

King, Indra, to take part in the yajnas [sacrifices] . Because King

Indra was thus absent so often from Sacidevi, she had to pass much

I

L

Astonishment and Chivalry

376

of her time pining over Indra's absence, with her cheeks upon her
hands."
The performance of different yajiias for the demigods is considered
to be worship of the limbs of the Supreme Lord. The demigods are
considered to be different parts of the universal body of the Lord,
and therefore the ultimate purpose in worshiping them is to please the
Lord by partially worshiping His different limbs. Maharaj Yudhi�thira
had no such material desire; he executed all sacrifices under the di­
rection of Krwa, and not to take any personal advantage from them.
He only desired to please Kr��a and was therefore called the best of
the devotees. He was always merged in the ocean of loving service.

4 7 I Compassion and Anger

Compassion
When the ecstasy of devotional service produces some kind of
lamentation in connection with Kr��a, it is called devotional service
in compassion. The impetus of this devotional service is Krwa's tran­

scendental quality, form and activities. In this ecstasy of devotional
service there are sometimes symptoms like regret, heavy breathing,

crying, falling on the ground and beating upon one's chest. Some­
times symptoms like laziness, frustration, defamation, humility, anxi­
ety, moroseness, eagerness, restlessness, madness, death, forgetfulness,

disease and illusion are also visible. When in the heart of a devotee
there is expectation of some mishap to Krwa it is called devotional
service in bereavement. Such bereavement is another symptom of

this devotional service in compassion.

In the Srimad-Bhiigavatam, Tenth Canto, 16th Chapter, 13th verse,

there is the following description. When Kr��a was chastising the
Kaliyanaga in the Yamuna, the big snake wrapped his coils all over
Kr��a's body, and upon seeing Kr��a in this situation, all His dear

cowherd friends became greatly disturbed. Out of bereavement, dis­

tress and fearfulness, they became bewildered and began to fall on
the ground. Because the cowherd boys were under the illusion that
Kr��a could be in some mishap, their symptoms are not at all aston­

ishing; they had dedicated their friendship, their possessions, their

desires and their very selves to Kr��a.

When Kr��a entered the Yamuna River, which had become very
poisonous from the presence of Kaliya, Mother Yasoda feared all
kinds of mishaps, and she was breathing hotly. Tears from her eyes
377

Compassion and Anger

378

were soaking her clothes, and she was almost collapsing.

Similarly, when the Sankhasura demon was attacking Kr�!la's

queens one after another, Lord Baladeva became more and more
bluish.

In the Harhsadiita, the following incident is described: The gopis

requested Hamsadiita to search after the marks of Kr��a's lotus feet

and to accept them as Lord Brahma had accepted them on his helmet

after he had stolen all Kr�!la 's cowherd boys. Regretting his challenge
to Kr��a, Lord Brahma had bowed down before the Lord, and his
helmet became marked with the footprints of Kr��a. The gopis re­
minded Hamsadiita that sometimes even the great sage Narada be­

comes very ecstatic by seeing these footprints, and sometimes great

liberated sages also aspire to see them. "You should therefore seek
very enthusiastically to find the footprints of Krwa," they urged.
This is another instance of devotional service in compassion.

There is another instance when Sahadeva, the younger brother of
Nakula, became greatly gladdened at seeing the effulgent glowing of

Kr�!la's footprints. He began to cry and call out, "Mother Madri!
Where are you now? Father Pa!l�u! Where are you now? I am very

sorry that you are not here to see these footprints of Kt$�a!" This is

another instance of devotional service in compassion.

In such devotional service in compassion there are sometimes

smiling symptoms, but never is there any stress or lamentation. The

basic principle is always ecstatic love. The apprehension of some
mishap to Kr�!la or to His beloved queens, as exhibited by Baladeva
and Yudhi�thira, has been explained above. This apprehension is not

exactly due to their ignorance of the inconceivable potencies of

Kr�!la but to their intense love for Him. This kind of apprehension
of some mishap to Kr�!la first of all becomes manifested as an object

of lamentation, but gradually it develops into such compassionate
loving ecstasy that it turns to another channel and gives transcen­
dental pleasure.

Anger
In ecstatic loving service to Kr�!la in anger, Kn;�a is always the ob-

379

The Nectar of Devotion

ject. In Vidagdha-miidhava, Second Canto, 53rd verse, Lalitagopi ex­

pressed her anger, which was caused by Kr��a, when she addressed

Srimati Radhara�i thus: "My dear friend, my inner desires have been

polluted. Therefore I shall go to the place of Yamaraja. But I am sor­

ry to see that Kr��a has still not given up His smiling over cheating
You. I do not know how You could repose all Your loving propensi­
ties upon this lusty young boy from the neighborhood of the cow­

herds."

After seeing Kr��a, Jarati sometimes said, "0 You thief of young

girls' properties! I can distinctly see the covering garment of my
daughter-in-law on Your person." Then she cried very loudly, ad­

dressing all the residents of V rndavana to inform them that this son
of King N anda was setting fire to the household life of her daughter­

in-law.

Similar ecstatic love for Kr��a in anger was expressed by Rohi¢"­

devi when she heard the roaring sound of the two falling arjuna trees

to which Krwa had been tied. The whole neighborhood proceeded

immediately towards the place where the accident took place, and
Rohi�idevi took the opportunity to rebuke Mother Yasoda as fol­

lows: "You may be very expert in giving lessons to your son by

binding Him with rope, but don't you look to see if your son is in a
dangerous spot? The trees are falling on the ground, and He is simply
loitering there!" This expression of Rohi�idevi's anger toward Yasoda

is an example of ecstatic love in anger caused by Kr��a.

Once, while Kr��a was in the pasturing ground with His cowherd

boys, His friends requested Him to go to the Talavana Forest, where

Gardabhasura, a disturbing demon in the shape of an ass, resided.
The friends of Kr��a wanted to eat the fruit from the forest trees,

but they could not go because of fear of the demon. Thus they re­

quested Kr�pa to go there and kill Gardabhasura. After Kr�pa did

this, they all returned home, and their report of the day's activity

perturbed Mother Yasoda because Kr�pa had been sent alone into

such danger in the Talavana Forest. Thus she looked upon the boys
with anger.

There is another instance of anger on the part of a friend of

Radhara�i's. When Radharapi was dissatisfied with the behavior of

Compassion and Anger

380

Kr�rta and had stopped talking with Him, Krwa was very sorry for
Radhararti's great dissatisfaction, and in order to beg forgiveness, He

fell down at Her lotus feet. But even after this, Radhararti was not

satisfied, and She did not talk with Kr�rta. At that time, one of Her

friends chastised Her in the following words: "My dear friend, You

are allowing Yourself to be churned by the rod of dissatisfaction, so

what can I say unto You? The only advice I can give You is that You

had better leave this scene immediately, because Your misbehavior

is giving me too much pain. I cannot bear to see Your behavior, be­

cause even though Kr�rta's peacock feather has touched Your feet,
You still appear to be red-faced."

The above attitudes of dissatisfaction and anger in devotional ser­

vice are called ir§yu.

When Uddhava was leaving Vrndavana, some of the elderly gopis

rebuked him as follows: "0 son of Gandini, your cruelty is defaming

the dynasty of King Yadu. You are taking Kr�rta away, keeping us in

such pitiable condition without Him. Now, even before you have
left, the life air of all the gopis has practically disappeared."

When Kr�rta was insulted by Sisupala in the assembly of riija-siiya

yajfia convened by Maharaj Yudhi�thira, there was a great turmoil
amongst the Part9avas and Kurus, involving grandfather Bhi�ma. At
that til_!le Nakula said with great anger, "Krwa is the Supreme Per­

sonality of Godhead, and the nails of His toes are beautified by the
light emanating from the jeweled helmets of the authorities of the
Vedas. If He is derided by anyone, I declare herewith as a Part9ava

that I will kick his helmet with my left foot, and I will strike him
with my arrows, which are as good as Yamadarz4a, the sceptor of
Yamaraja!" This is an instance of ecstatic love for Kr�p.a in anger.

In such a transcendental angry mood sometimes sarcastic remarks,

unfavorable glances and insulting words are exhibited. Sometimes

there are other symptoms, like rubbing the two hands, clacking the
teeth, clamping the lips, moving the eyebrows, scratching the arms,

lowering the head, breathing rapidly, uttering strong words, nodding
the head, exhibiting yellowishness at the corner of the eyes, and exhi­

biting trembling lips. Sometimes the eyes turn red, and sometimes

they fade. And there is sometimes chastisement and silence. All these

�

381

The Nectar of Devotion

symptoms of anger can be divided into two parts: constitutional and

unconstitutional, or permanent and temporary symptoms. Some­
times great emotion, bewilderment, pride, frustration, illusion, im­

potence, jealousy, dexterity, negligence and signs of hard labor are

also manifest as unconstitutional symptoms.

In all these humors of ecstatic love, the feeling of anger is accepted

as the steady factor.

When J arasandha angrily attacked the city of Mathura, he looked

at Kr�!la with sarcastic glances. At that time Baladeva took up His

plow weapon and gazed upon J arasandha with colored eyes.

There is a statement in the Vidagdha-miidhava wherein Sr1mat1

Radhara!l-1, in an angry mood, addressed Her mother, Paur!lamas1,

after she had accused Radhara!l-1 of going to Kr�!la. "My dear moth­

er," Radha declared, "what can I say to you? Krwa is so cruel that

He often attacks Me on the street, and if I want to cry out veryloud�

ly, this boy with a peacock feather on His head immediately covers

My face so that I cannot cry. And if I want to go away from the scene

because I am afraid of Him, He will immediately spread His arms to

block My path. If I piteously fall down at His feet, then this enemy
of the Madhu demon, in an angry mood, bites My face! Mother, just

try to understand My situation, and don't be unnecessarily angry with

Me. Instead, please tell Me how I can save Myself from these terrible

attacks of Kr�!la!"

Sometimes amongst contemporary personalities there are signs of

ecstasy in anger because of love for Kr�!la. An example of such anger
was exhibited in the quarrel between Jatila and Mukhara. Jatila was
the mother-in-law of Radhara!l-1, and Mukhara was Her great grand­

mother. Both of them were talking about Krwa's unnecessary har­

rassment of Radhara!l-1 when She was walking on the street. Jatila

said, "You cruel-faced Mukhara! By hearing your words my heart

feels like it is burning in a fire!" And Mukhara replied, "You sinful
Jatila, by hearing your words, there is aching in my head! You cannot

give any evidence that Kr�!la has attacked Radhara!l-1, the daughter of
my granddaughter Kirtida."

Once, when Radhara!l-1 was taking off the necklace given to Her by

Kr�!la, Jatila, her mother-in-law, told a friend: "My dear friend, just

Compassion and Anger

382

see the beautiful necklace that Kr��a has presented to Radhara�i.

She is now holding it, but still she wants to tell us that She has no

connection with Kr��a. This girl's activities have disgraced our whole

family!"

Natural jealousy of Kr��a by persons like Sisupala cannot be ac­

cepted as ecstatic love in anger with Kr��a.

48 I Dread and Ghastliness

Dread
In ecstatic love for Knp.a in dread, there are two causes of fear:
either Kr9p.a Himself or some dreadful situation for Kr9tta. When a
devotee feels himself to be an offender at Kr9tta's lotus feet, at that
time Kr9tta Himself becomes the objective of dreadful ecstatic love.
And when out of ecstatic love friends and well-wishers of Kr9p.a
apprehend some danger for Him, that situation becomes the object of
their dread.
When ij,k9araj was in front of Krwa fighting and 'suddenly realized
that Krwa is the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Kr9tta addressed
him thus: "My dear ij,k9araj, why is your face so dry? Please do not
feel threatened by Me. There is no need for your heart to tremble like
this. Please calm yourself down. I have no anger toward you. You
can, however, become as angry as you like with Me-to expand your
service in fighting with Me and to increase My sporting attitude." In
this dreadful situation in ecstatic love for Kr9p.a, Kr9pa Himself is the
object of dread.
There is another instance of a dreadful situation with Kr�p.a as the
object as follows: After being sufficiently chastised by child Kr9p.a in
the Yamuna River, the Kaliya snake began to address the Lord, "0
killer of the Mura demon, I have acquired many mystic powers by my
austerity and penances, but before You I am nothing, I am most in­
significant. Therefore, please be kind upon a poor soul like me, and
don't be angry with me. I did not know Your actual position, and
out of ignorance I have committed such horrible offenses. Please
383

Dread and Ghastliness

384

save me. I am a most unfortunate, foolish creature. Please be merciful

to me." This is another instance of the ecstasy of dread in devotional
serVIce.

When the KeSi demon was causing disturbance in V rndavana by

assuming a large horse's body that was so big that he could jump over

the trees, Mother Y asoda told her husband, N anda Maharaj, "Our
child is very restless, so we had better keep Him locked up within the

house. I have been very worried about the recent disturbances of the
Kesi demon, who has been assuming the form of a giant horse." When

it was learned that the demon was entering Gokula in an angry mood,

Mother Y asoda became so anxious to protect her child that her face

dried up and there were tears in her eyes. These are some of the

signs of the ecstasy of dread in devotional service, caused by seeing

and hearing something that is dangerous to K.r9pa.

After the Putana witch had been killed, some friends of Mother

Y asoda inquired from her about the incident. Mother Y asoda at once

requested her friends, "Please stop! Please stop! Don't bring up the

incident of PUtana. I become distressed just by remembering this

incident. The Putana witch came to devour my son, and she deceived

me into letting her take the child on her lap. After that, she died and
made a tumultuous sound with her gigantic body."

In the ecstasy of devotional service in dread, the unconstitutional

symptoms are drying up of the mouth, exuberance, glancing towards

the back side, concealing oneself, bewilderment, searching after the

endangered lovable object and crying very loudly. Some other un­

constitutional symptoms are illusion, forgetfulness, and expectation
of danger. In all such circumstances the ecstatic dread is the steady or

constant factor. Such dreadfulness is caused either by offenses com­

mitted or by dreadful circumstances. Offenses can be committed in

varieties of ways, and the dread is felt by the person who has com­

mitted the offense. When dread is caused by a fearful object, this
fearful object is generally a person who is fearsome in his features,

nature and influence. An example of an object which caused ecstatic

dread is the Putanii witch. Dread can be caused by mischievous de­

monic characters, such as King Kamsa, and it can be caused by great
powerful demigods, such as lndra or Sankara.

385

The Nectar of Devotion

Demons like Kamsa feared Kr�!ia, but their feelings cannot be
described as ecstatic dread in devotional service.

Ghastliness
It is understood from authoritative sources that an attachment for
Krwa because of feelings of disgust sometimes presents a ghastly
ecstasy in devotional service. The person experiencing such ecstatic
love for Kr�!la is almost always in the neutral stage of devotional ser­
vice; or siinta-rasa. A description of ecstatic love caused by ghastliness
is found in the following statement: "This person was formerly in­
terested solely in the matter of lust and sense gratification, and he
had perfected the greatest skill in exploiting women to fulfill his
lusty desires. But now how wonderful it is that this same man is
chanting the names of Kr�!la with tears in his eyes, and as soon as he
sees the face of a woman, he immediately becomes disgusted. From
the indication of his face, I would think that now he hates sex life."
In this mellow of devotional service in ghastliness, the sub-ecstatic
symptoms are spitting upon the consideration of one's past life, con­
torting the face, covering the nose and washing the hands. There is
also trembling of the body, forcible twisting of the body and perspir­
ation. Other symptoms which may be present are shame, exhaustion,
madness, illusion, frustration, humility, self-pity, restlessness, eager­
ness and stunning of the body.
When a devotee, lamenting for his past abominable activities, shows
special symptoms on his body, his feeling is called ecstasy in devo­
tional service in ghastliness. This is caused by the awakening of his
Kr�!ia consciousness.
In this connection there is the following statement: "How can a
person take pleasure in the enjoyment of sex life in this body, which
is a bag of skin and bones, filled with blood, covered by skin and
flesh and which produces mucus and evil smells?" This perception is
::I

possible only for one who is awakened to Kr�!la consciousness and
who has become fully cognizant of the abominable nature of this
material body.

Dread and Ghastliness

386

A fortunate child in the womb of his mother prayed to Kr�tta as
follows: "0 enemy of Kamsa, I am suffering so much because of this
material body. Now I am trapped within a mess of blood, urine and
liquid stool, within the womb of my mother. Because I am living in
such a condition, I am suffering great pangs. Therefore, 0 divine ocean
of mercy, please be kind to me. I have no capacity to be engaged in
Your loving devotional service, but please save me!" There is a similar
statement by a person fallen in the hellish condition of life. He ad­
dressed the Supreme Lord thus: "My dear Lord, Yamaraja has placed
me in a situation which is full of filthy and obnoxious smells. There
are so many insects and worms, surrounded by the stools left by dif­
ferent kinds of diseased persons. And after visualizing this horrible
scene, my eyes have become sore, and I am becoming nearly blind. I
therefore pray, 0 my Lord, 0 deliverer from the hellish conditions of
life. I have fallen into this hell, but I shall try to remember Your holy
name always, and in this way I shall try to keep my body and soul
together." This is another instance of ecstatic love for Kr�tta in an
abominable situation.
It is to be understood that any person who is constantly engaged
in chanting the holy names of the Lord, Hare Kr9tJ.a, Hare Kr�tJ.a,
Kr�tta Krwa, Hare Hare/ Hare Rama, Hare Rama, Rama Rama, Hare
Hare, has attained a transcendental affection for Kr9tJ.a, and as such,

in any condition of life, he remains satisfied simply by remembering
the Lord's name in full affection and ecstatic love.
In conclusion, it may be stated that the ecstatic love for Kr�tta
in ghastliness appears during the development of dormant neutrality
into developed affection.

49 I Mixing of Rasas

As already described, there are twelve different kinds of rasas, or ec­
static relationships which are shared with Kr�!la. Five of these rasas
are direct, and they are listed as neutrality, servitude, fraternal love,
parental love, and conjugal love. Seven of the rasas are indirect, and
they are listed as humor, astonishment, chivalry, compassion, anger,
dread and ghastliness. The five direct rasas are eternally manifested
in the Vaiku!ltha world, the spiritual kingdom, whereas the seven in­
direct rasas are eternally manifesting and unmanifesting in Gokula
Vrndavana, where Kr�!ia displays His transcendental pastimes in the
material world.
Very often, in addition to one's regular rasa, there is found the
presence of some other rasa, and the mixture of these loving humors
is sometimes compatible, or palatable, and sometimes incompatible,
or unpalatable. The following is a scientific analysis of the compati­
bility and incompatibility of the mixtures of these various rasas, or
loving moods.
When in the rasa of neutral love (santa-rasa) there are found
traces of dread or astonishment, the result is compatible. When with
this neutral love there are manifestations of conjugal love, chivalry,
anger or dread, the result is incompatible.
When in the ecstasy of a serving humor, there are manifestations
of dread, neutral love, or chivalry (such as dharma-vira and diina-vira)
the result is compatible. The ecstasy of devotional service in chivalry

(yuddha-vira) and anger are directly produced by Kr�!ia Himself.
With the ecstasy of fraternal love, a mixture of conjugal love,
laughter or chivalry is highly compatible. With the same fraternal
387

Mixing of Rasas

388

love, a mixture of dread or parental love is most incompatible.
Although there are gulfs of differences between them, with the
ecstasy of parental affection, a mixture of laughter, compassion or
dread is compatible.
With the ecstasy of parental love, a mixture of conj ugal love,
chivalry or anger is incompatible.
With the ecstasy of devotion in conj ugal love, a mixture of laugh­
ter or fraternity is compatible.
According to certain expert opinions, in the ecstasy of conj ugal
love, the feelings of chivalry which are known as _yuddha-vira and

dharma-vira are the only compatible additions. According to this
view, except for these two humors, all other manifestations are taken
as incompatible with conj ugal love.
With the ecstasy of devotional laughter, a mixture of dread, con­

j ugal love or parental love is compatible, whereas a mixture of com­
passion or ghastliness is incompatible.
With the ecstasy of devotion in astonishment, a mixture of chivalry
or neutral love is compatible; whereas a mixture of anger or dread is
always incompatible.
With the ecstasy of devotional chivalry, a mixture of astonishment,
laughter or servitude is compatible, while a mixture of dread or con­

j ugal love is incompatible. According to some expert opinions, the
ecstasy of neutral love is always compatible with devotional service
in chivalry.
With the ecstasy of compassion in devotional service, a mixture of
anger or parental love is compatible; while a mixture of laughter, con­

j ugal love or astonishment is always incompatible.
With the ecstasy of anger in devotional service, a mixture of com­
passion or chivalry is compatible; while a mixture of laughter, con­

j ugal union or dread is completely incompatible.
With the ecstasy of dread in devotional service, a mixture of ghast­
liness or compassion is compatible.
With the ecstasy of chivalry in devotional service, a mixture of
conj ugal union, laughter or anger is always incompatible.
In the ecstasy of ghastliness in devotional service, feelings of
neutral love, laughter or servitude are compatible; whereas feelings

_j

389

The Nectar of Devotion

of conj ugal union and fraternity are incompatible.
The above analysis is a sample of the study of rasiibhiisa or incom­
patible mixing of rasas. This transcendental science of rasiibhiisa can
thoroughly explain the humors in ecstatic love which are compatible
and incompatible with one another. When Lord Caitanya Mahaprabhu
was residing in J agannatha Purl, many poets and devotees used to
come to Him and offer their different kinds of poetry, but the regu­
lation was that Lord Caitanya's secretary, Svariipa Damodara, first
examined all of these writings scrutinizingly, and then if he would
find that there were no incompatibilities in the rasas, or transcenden­
tal mellows, he would then allow the poet to approach Lord Caitanya
and recite his poetry.
The topic of incompatibility is a very important one, and those
who are pure devotees always expect to find perfect compatibility in
descriptions of the different relationships with the Personality of
Godhead. The study of compatibility and incompatibility sometimes
becomes very involved, and a hint of why this is so is given as fol­
lows: When a friend meets another friend, the mellow produced out
of that meeting is generally taken as very palatable. But actually with
such meetings between two friends, there are so many feelings in­
volved that it is difficult to ascertain when these feelings are actually
becoming compatible and when they are becoming incompatible.
Expert literary scholars have analyzed the rasas which are compati­
ble with one another by contrasting the various rasas in a particular
mixture under the names "whole" and "part." According to this
method, the prominent feeling is called the "whole," and the sub­
ordinate feeling is called the "part."
The following statement elucidates the subj ect of part and whole:
"All living entities are j ust like sparks from the supreme fire, and as
such, I do not know if I, a tiny spark, shall be able to engage myself
in the transcendental loving service of this supreme fire, Lord Krwa."
In this statement, the feelings of neutral love are taken as the whole,
whereas the desire to serve the Lord is taken as the part. Actually, in
the Brahman effulgence there is no chance for reciprocation of loving
ecstasy between the Lord and the devotee.
There is another quotation by a devotee who laments as follows:

Mixing of Rasas

390

"Alas, I am still trying to relish different pleasurable states from this

body, which is simply some skin covering mucus, semina and blood.

In this state of consciousness I am so condemned that I cannot relish

the transcendental ecstasy of remembering the Supreme Personality

of Godhead." In this statement there are two ecstatic loving humors,

namely neutrality and ghastliness. Neutrality is taken here as the
whole, whereas the ecstasy of ghastliness is the part.

There is a similar statement by a devotee as follows: "I shall now

begin my service of fanning the Supreme Personality of Godhead, Sri
Kr�!J.a, who is seated on a golden throne. He is the supreme Param­

brahma in His eternal transcendental form of a cloudy blackish com­

plexion. Now I shall give up my affection for my material body,

which is nothing but a bunch of flesh and blood." Herein also there

is a combination of servitude and ghastliness, where the ecstasy of
servitude is taken as the whole, and the ecstasy of ghastliness is taken

as the part.

There is another statement as follows: "When shall I be freed from

the mode of ignorance? And being thus purified, when shall I attain

the stage of serving Kr�!la eternally? Only then shall I be able to wor­

ship Him, always observing His lotus eyes and beautiful face." In this

statement the whole is the ecstasy of neutrality, and the part is ser­

vitorship.

There is another statement as follows: "Please look at this devotee

of the Lord who is dancing just from remembering the lotus feet of
Kr�!J.a. Simply by observing his dance you will lose all interest in even

the most beautiful women!" In this statement the whole is in neu­
trality, and the part is in ghastliness.

One devotee boldly said, "My dear Lord, now I am turning my

face from any thought of association with young girls. As far as

Brahman realization is concerned, I have lost all interest because I am

completely absorbed in thinking about You. And being absorbed so
blissfully, I have lost all other desires, even the desire for mystic
powers. Now my mind is only attracted to worshiping Your lotus

feet." In this statement, the whole is the ecstasy of neutrality, and

the part is chivalry.

In another statement, Subala is addressed thus: "My dear Subala,

391

The Nectar of Devotion

the damsels of Vrndavana who had the opportunity of enjoying
Kr�!ia's kissing must be the foremost of all the fortunate women in
the world." In this example, the ecstasy of fraternal devotional ser·
vice is the whole, and the ecstasy of conjugal love is the part.
The following statement was made by Kr�!ia to the gopis: "My
dear enchanted, don't gaze at Me with longing eyes like this. Be satis­
fied arrd return to your homes in Vrndavana. There is no necessity of
your presence here." While Kr�!ia was joking in this way with the
damsels of Braja, who with great hope had come to enjoy the riisa
dance with Him, Subala was also on the scene, and he began to look
at Kr�!ia with wide and laughing eyes. Subala's feeling contained a
mixture of fraternity and laughter in devotional service. Fraternity
is considered here as the whole, and the laughter is considered as the
part.
The following example contains a mixture of ecstatic fraternity
and laughter, taken respectively as the whole and part. When Kr�!J.a
saw that Subala, in the dress of Radhara!J.'i, was silently hiding under
the shade of a beautiful asoka tree on the bank of the Yamuna, He
immediately arose from His seat in surprise. Upon seeing Kr�!J.a,
Subala tried to hide his laughter by covering his cheeks.
There is also an example of a mixture of parental love and com­
passion in devotional service. When Mother Yasoda was thinking that
her son was walking in the forest without any umbrella or shoes, she
became greatly perturbed to think of how much difficulty Kr�!la
must have been feeling. In this example the whole is the paternal
love, and the part is compassion.
There is the following example of a mixture of parental love and
laughter. A friend of Mother Yasoda told her, "My dear Yasoda, your
son has very cunningly stolen a lump of butter from my home. And
to make me blame my own son for His mischief, He has smeared
some of the butter on my son's face while he was sleeping!" Upon
hearing this, Mother Yasoda shook her curved eyebrows. She could
only look at her friend with a smiling face. May Mother Yasoda bless
everyone with this smiling attitude. In this example the whole is the
parental love, and the part is the laughter.
There is an example of a mixture of several humors with devo-

Mixing of Rasas

392

tional service as follows. When Kr�!la was holding up Govardhan Hill

with His left hand, His hairs became scattered all over His shoulders,

and He appeared to be perspiring. When Mother Yasoda saw this

scene, she began to tremble. Then, as she stared at the scene with
broadened eyes, she saw Krwa begin to exhibit varieties of facial

caricatures. Mother Yasoda then became very happy and began to

smile. Then again, when she thought that Kr�!la was holding up the

hill for such an extremely long time, her clothes became soaked with
perspiration. May Mother Yasoda Brajesvari protect the whole uni­

verse by her infinite mercy! In this example, the whole is parental

love, and the part is dread, wonder, laughter, compassion, etc.

There is an example of a mixture of conjugal love and fraternal af­

fection when Srimati Radhara!li said, "My dear friends, just see how

Kr�!la is resting His hand on the shoulder of Subala, who is dressed

up just like a young girl! I think He must be sending some message to

Me through Subala. The purport is that the superiors of Radhara!li
do not like Kr�!la or His cowherd friends to associate with Her; there­

fore these friends sometimes clothe themselves in female dress so

they can give Radhara!li a message from Krwa. In this example the

whole is conjugal love and the part is fraternity.

The following is an example of a mixture of conjugal love and

laughter in devotional service: Kr�!la, in the dress of a young girl,

told Radhara!li, "Oh, You hard-hearted girl! Don't You know that I
am Your sister? Why are You unable to recognize Me? Be merciful

upon Me and please capture My shoulders and embrace Me with

love!" While Kr�!la was dressed up exactly like Radhara!li, He was

speaking these nice words, and Srimati Radhara!li could understand
His purpose. But because She was in front of many of Her superiors,

She simply smiled and did not say anything. In this instance, the
ecstasy of conjugal love is taken as the whole, and the ecstasy of

laughter is taken as the part.

The following illustrates a mixture of several feelings. When one of

the consort friends of Candravali saw that Krwa was preparing to

fight with the Vr�asura demon, she began to think: "How wonderful
Kr�!la is! His mind is captivated by the eyebrows of Candravali in a

smiling spirit, His snake-like arms are on the shoulder of His friend,

393

The Nectar of Devotion

and at the same time He is roaring like a lion to encourage V r�asura
to fight with Him!" This is an example of conjugal love, fraternity,

and chivalry. The conjugal love is taken here as the whole, and the
fraternity and chivalry are taken as the parts.

When Kubja caught hold of Kr��a's yellow garment because she

was feeling almost lusty with sex urge, Kr��a simply bowed down His
head with His cheeks glowing in front of the many people who were

standing there and laughing. This is an example of a mixture of

ecstatic conjugal love and laughter. The laughter is taken as the
whole, and the conjugal love is taken as the part.

Visala, a cowherd boy who was attempting to fight with Bhadra­

sena, was addressed by another cowherd boy as follows: "Why are

you attempting to show your chivalrous spirit before me? Before

this, you even attempted to fight with Sridama, but you must know
that Sridama does not even care to fight with hundreds of Balaramas.

So why are you acting so enthusiastically when you actually have no

importance at all?" This is an example of a mixture of devotional
fraternity and chivalry. The chivalry is taken as the whole, and the
fraternity is taken as the part.

Sisupala was habituated to calling Kr��a ill names, and by his in­

sults he irritated the sons of Pandu more than he irritated Krsna. The
.

.

.

.

.

Pa��avas therefore equipped themselves with all kinds of weapons

to kill Sisupala. Their feelings were a mixture of ecstatic anger and
fraternity, the anger being taken as the whole, and fraternity as the

part.

Once Kr��a was watching Sridama very expertly using his stick to

fight with Balarama, who was an expert club-fighter and who had

even killed the Pralambasura demon with His club. When Krsna saw
·
Balarama finally defeated by Sridama, who was using onl � small

y

stick, Krwa became filled with pleasure and began to look upon

Sridama with great wonder. In this instance there is a mixture of

astonishment, fraternity and chivalry in devotional service. The fra­

ternity and chivalry are considered as the parts, and the astonishment

is considered as the whole.

Expert analyzers of these various kinds of mellows instruct us that

when different mellows overlap one another, the mellow which is the

Mixing of Rasas

394

whole, or the prominent humor, is called the permanent ecstasy. It is
confirmed in the Vi§r-u-dharmottara that when there are many mel­
lows of devotional ecstasy mixed together, the prominent one, or the
whole, is called the steady ecstasy of devotional service. Although
the subordinate mellow may be manifested for a certain time, at
length it will become merged into the prominent whole. Thus it is
called an unconstitutional ecstasy of devotional service.
There is a good analogy in this connection, showing the relation­
ship between the part and the whole. Lord Vamanadeva is actually
the Supreme Personality of Godhead, but He appeared to have been
"born" as one of the brothers of lndra. Although Vamanadeva is
sometimes taken as a less-important demigod, He is actually the
maintainer of lndra, the King of the demigods. Thus, although some­
times Vamanadeva is considered to be a subordinate demigod, His
actual position is that of the supreme whole, the source of the entire
demigod system. In the same way, a rasa which is actually prominent
may sometimes appear to be manifested in a subordinate way, al­
though its actual position is as the main or prominent loving feeling
of a devotee.
When an unconstitutional ecstasy of devotional service is mani­
fested prominently at a certain time, it is still accepted as the part. If
it is not very prominently manifested, it appears only slightly and
quickly merges back into the whole. At such times of slight ap­

pearance, no consideration is given to it; as when one is eating some
palatable dishes, if one also eats a small blade of grass, he will not
taste it, nor will he care to distinguish what its taste is like.

50 I Further Analysis of Mixed Rasas

As already described, if certain kinds of mellows become mixed

and there is a joining of opposite mellows, then the situation is called

incompatible. When one is eating sweet rice and something salty or
sour is mixed in, the mixture is not very tasteful, and it is called in­

compatible.

An exemplary instance of incompatibility is the following state­

ment by an impersonalist who was lamenting aloud, "I have been at­
tached simply to the impersonal Brahman feature, and I have passed
my days uselessly in practicing trance. I have not given any proper at­

tention to Sri Kr��a, who is the source of the impersonal Brahman

and who is the reservoir of all transcendental pleasures." In this

statement there are traces of neutrality and conjugal love, and the

resulting humor is incompatible.

Sometimes it is found in places like Vrndavana that a person with

a slight devotional attitude of neutral love for Kr��a may immediate­

ly and artificially try to attain to the platform of conjugal love. But

because of the incompatibility of neutrality and conjugal love, the

person is found to fall from the standard of devotional service.

Incompatibility was expressed by a great devotee on the platform

of neutrality when he sarcastically prayed, "I am very anxious to see
Kr��a, the Supreme Personality of Godhead, who is many millions of

times more affectionate than the pitrs (forefathers) in the Pitr-loka,

and who is always worshiped by the great demigods and sages. I am a

little surprised, however, that although Krwa is the husband of the

goddess of fortune, His body is often marked with the nail pricks of

ordinary society girls!" Here is an example of incompatibility due to

a mixture of neutrality and high conjugal love.

Analysis of Mixed Rasas

396

There is the following statement by a gopi: "My dear Kr�pa, the

first thing You should do is just embrace me with Your strong arms.
Then, my dear friend, I shall first smell Your head, and then I shall
enjoy with You." This is an example of incompatibility in which
conjugal love is the whole and servitorship is the part.

One devotee said, "My dear Kr�pa, how can I address You as my

son when You are addressed by the great V edantists as the absolute
truth and by the Vai§rz.avas who follow the principles of Niirada­

pancariitra as the Supreme Personality of Godhead? You are the same

Supreme Person, so how shall my tongue be so extraordinarily bold

as to address You as an ordinary son?" In this statement there is a
mixture of neutrality and parental love, and the result is incom­
patible.

Another devotee said, "My dear friend, my youthful beauty is as

temporary as lightning in the sky, and therefore, my possessing at­

tractive bodily features is unimportant. I have never met Kr�pa, so I

request you to please arrange for my meeting Him immediately." In

this statement there is the incompatibility of a neutral mellow mixed

with conjugal love.

A lusty woman in Kailasa once told Kr�pa: "My dear Kr�pa, may

You have a long life!" Then, after saying this, she embraced Kr�pa.

This is an example of incompatibility resulting from a mixture of

parental love and conjugal love.

The purpose of the above analysis is to show that in the mixture

of various mellows, or reciprocations of ecstatic love between Kr�pa
and the devotees, if the result is not pure, there will he incompati­

bility. According to the opinion of stalwart devotees like Riipa Go­

svami, as soon as there are contradictory feelings, the result is in­
compatible.

Once an ordinary female devotee addressed Kr�pa, "My dear boy,

I know that my body is just a composition of flesh and blood and

can never be enjoyable to You. But still, I have been so attracted by
Your beauty that I wish that You accept me as Your conjugal lover."

In this statement there is incompatibility caused by a mixture of
ghastliness and conjugal love in devotional service.

Srila Riipa Gosvami warns devotees to not commit such incompati­

bilities in their writings or in their dealings. The presence of such

1'1

,,

�

I

397

The Nectar of Devotion

contradictory feelings is called rasiibhiisa. When there is rasiibhiisa in

any book of Kr��a consciousness, no learned scholar or devotee will
accept it.
In the

Vidagdha-miidhava, second act, verse 29, Paur�amasi tells

Nandimukhi: "Just see how wonderful it is! Great sages meditate

upon Kr��a after being relieved from all material transactions, and

with great difficulty they try to situate Krwa in their hearts. And

opposed to this, this young girl is trying to withdraw her mind from
Kr��a so she can apply it in the material activities of sense gratifica­

tion. What a regrettable thing it is that this girl is trying to drive away

from her heart the same Kr��a who is sought after by great sages
through severe austerities and perseverance!" Although in this state­
ment there are contradictory mellows of ecstatic devotion, the result
is not incompatible because conj ugal love is so elevated that it is de­

feating all other varieties of mellows. Srila }iva Gosvami comments in

this connection that such a loving state of mind is not possible for

all. It is only possible in the case of the gopis of V rndiivana. There

are many other instances of contradictory mellows where there is no
perverted experience of rasiibhiisa.
Once some minor demigod of the heavenly planets remarked:

"Kr��a, whose j oking words were once the source of so much laugh­

ter for the residents of Braj a, has now been attacked by the serpent

king, Kaliya, and He has become the obj ect of everyone's over­
whelming lamentation!" In this instance there is a mixture of laugh­

ter and compassion, but there is no incompatibility because by both
of these rasas the loving affection for Kr��a is increased.

Srimati Radhiira�i was once told that although She had stopped

all activities, She was still the supreme source of inspiration for all
kinds of devotional service. The statement says, "My dear Radhiirii�i,
in separation from Krwa You are now as still as the most beautiful

tree, whose gracefulness is not blocked by any covering of leaves.

Your tranquil mood makes You appear to be completely merged in

Brahman realization!" In this example there is a mixture of conj ugal
love and neutral love, but the conj ugal love has surpassed everything.

Actually, Brahman realization is only a stunted existence. There is

the following statement by Kr��a Himself: "Srimati Radhara�i has

Analysis of Mixed Rasas

398

become peace personified for Me. Because of Her I now go without
sleep. I stare constantly without blinking my eyes, and I am always

in a meditative mood. Because of Her I have even made My home in
the cave of a mountain!" This is an example of conj ugal love mixed
with neutral love, but there is no incompatibility.

The following is a conversation consisting of questions put before

Rambha, a celebrated beautiful woman, and her corresponding an­

swers. Rambha was asked, "My dear Rambha, who are you?" She

answered, "I am peace personified." Question: "Then why are you in

the sky?" Answer: "I am in the sky to experience the supreme abso­

lute truth." Question: "Then why are you staring?" Answer: "Just

to look into the supreme beauty of the absolute truth." Question:

"Then why do you appear to be disturbed in mind?" Answer: "Be­

cause Cupid is acting." In the above example also there is no per­

verted representation of mellows because on the whole the ecstasy of
conj ugal love has exceeded the neutral position of devotional service.

In the Tenth Canto of Srimad-Bhiigavatam, 60th Chapter, 44th

verse, Rukmi�idevi said, "My dear husband, a woman who has no

taste for the transcendental pleasure available from Your personal

contact must be inclined to accept as her husband somebody who is

externally a combination of mustaches, beard, body hairs, fingernails
and some head hair. And within him there are muscles, bones, blood,
intestinal worms, stools, mucus, bile, and similar things. Actually,

such a husband is only a dead body, but due to not being attracted
to Your transcendental form, a woman will have to accept this combi­

nation of stools and urine for her husband." This statement, which

lists the ingredients of a material body, is not a perverted mellow in
transcendental realization because it shows correct discrimination be­

tween matter and spirit.

In the Vidagdha-miidhava, second act, 42nd verse, Kr��a tells His

friend, "My dear friend, what a wonderful thing it is that since I have

seen the beautiful lotus eyes of Srimati Radhara�i, I have developed
a tendency to spit on the moon and the lotus flower!" This is an

example of conj ugal love mixed with ghastliness, but there is no in­
compatibility.

The following is a statement which describes different mellows of

399

The Nectar of Devotion

devotional service: "Although Kr�pa was invincible to any enemy,

the cowherd boys of Vrndavana became almost blackish with aston­
ishment upon seeing His wonderful royal garments and His fighting
feats on the battlefield of Kuruk�etra." In this statement, although

there is a mixture of chivalrous activities and astonishment in devo­
tional service, there is no perverted reflection of mellows.

One resident of Mathura requested her father to bolt the doors

and then go with her to the school of Sandipani Muni to find Kr�pa.

She complained that Kr9pa had completely stolen her mind. In this

incident there is a mixture of conjugal love and parental love, but
there is no incompatibility.

A brahmiinandi (impersonalist) expressed his desire as follows:

"When shall I be able to see that supreme absolute Personality of

Godhead who is eternal bliss and knowledge, and whose chest has be­

come smeared with red kunkum powder by touching the breast of
Rukmipi?" Here there is a mixture of conjugal love and neutrality.

Although this is a contradiction of mellows, there is no incompati­
bility because even a brahmiinandi will become attracted to Krwa.

Nanda Maharaj told his wife, "My dear Y asoda, although your son,

Kr?pa, is as delicate and soft as the mallikii flower, He has gone to
kill the Kesi demon, who is as strong as the mountain. Therefore I

have become a little disturbed. But never mind, all auspiciousness to

my son! I shall raise this hand which is as strong as a pillar, and I shall

kill the Kesi demon, just to give freedom from all anxieties to the in­

habitants of Brajamap�ala!" In this statement there are two kinds of

mellows: chivalry and dread. Both of them, however, improve the

position of parental love, and therefore there is no incompatibility.

In the Lalita-miidhava of Srila Riipa Gosvami it is stated, "After

Krwa's arrival in Kamsa's arena, Kamsa's priest looked at Kr�pa with
a detestful expression. The entire arena was filled with dread on the

part of Kamsa and his priest and restless expressions of pleasure on
the cheeks of Kr�pa's friends. Frustration was felt by His envious

rivals. The great sages meditated. Hot tears were in the eyes of
Devaki and other motherly ladies, and hairs stood on the bodies of

the expert warriors. There was astonishment in the hearts of demi­

gods such as Indra. The servants danced, and the restless eyes of all

Analysis of Mixed Rasas

400

the young girls glanced about." In this statement there is a descrip­
tion of a combination of different mellows, but there is no incom­
patibility.
A similar statement, which is free from incompatibility, is in the

Lalita-madhava wherein the author blesses all the readers of the book
in the following manner: "Although the Supreme Personality of
Godhead is able to lift a mountain with a finger of His left hand, He
is always humble and meek. He is always very kind to His loving devo­
tees. He has frustrated Indra's attempt at vengeance by refusing him
the sacrifice of Indra-yajiia. He is the cause of all pleasure to all
young girls. May He be ever compassionate upon you all!"

51 I Perverted Expression of Mellows

Rasabhasa, or incompatible mixtures of mellows, can be classified

as uparasa (false expression) anurasa (imitation) and aparasa (per­
verted or misrepresented mellows).
There is the following statement by an impersonalist who had just
seen Kr�!la: "When a person has passed completely from all con­
tamination of material existence, he relishes a transcendental bliss of
being established in trance. But as soon as I saw You, the original
Personality of Godhead, I experienced the same bliss." This perverted
reflection of mellows is called santa-u parasa, or a perverted reflection
of mixed impersonalism and personalism.
There is another statement as follows: "Wherever I am glancing I
simply see Your personality. Therefore I know You are the uncon­
taminated Brahman effulgence, the supreme cause of all causes. I
think there is nothing but You in this cosmic manifestation." This is
another example of uparasa, or a perverted reflection of impersonal­
ism and personalism.
When Madhumari.gala, an intimate friend of Kr�!la, was dancing be­
fore Kr�!la in a joking manner, no one was paying attention to him,
and he jokingly said, "My dear Lord, please be merciful upon me. I
am praying for Your mercy." This is an example of uparasa in fra­
ternal affection and neutrality.
Kamsa once addressed his sister Devaki as follows: "My dear sister,
having seen your dear son Kr�!la, I think that He is so strong that He
can kill even wrestlers strong as the mountains. So I will have no
more anxieties about Him, even if He is engaged in a terrible fight."
This is an instance of uparasa in a perverted reflection of parental
love.
401

Perverted Expression of Mellows

402

In the Lalita-miidhava, Srila Rupa Gosvami says, "The wives of the

yajfiic briihmav-as were all young girls, and they were attracted to

Kr��a in the same way as the gopis of Vrndavana. Out of their at­

traction they distributed food to Kr��a." Here the two devotional
mellows are conjugal love and parental love, and the result is called
upa-rasa in conjugal love.

One of the friends of Srimati Radhara�i told Her, "My dear friend

Gandharvika [Radhara�i], You were the most chaste girl in our vil­

lage, but now You have divided Yourself and are partially chaste and

partially unchaste. It is all due to Cupid's influence upon You after
You saw Krwa and heard the sound of His flute." This is another ex­

ample of uparasa caused by divided interests in conjugal love.

According to some expert learned scholars, the feelings between

lover and beloved create perverted reflections of mellows in many

ways.

"The gopis have become purified by Krwa's glance, and as such,

Cupid's influence is distinctly visible on their bodies." Although in

the material sense the glancing of a boy at a girl is a kind of pollution,

when Kr��a threw His transcendental glance at the gopis, they be­
came purified. In other words, because Kr��a is the absolute truth,

any action by Him is transcendentally pure.

After Krwa chastised the Kaliyanaga in the Yamuna River by

dancing on his heads, the Kaliyanaga's wives addressed Kr�!la, "My

dear cowherd boy, we are all only young wives of the Kiliyanaga, so

why do you agitate our minds by sounding Your flute?" Kaliya's
wives were flattering Krwa so that He would spare their husband.
Therefore this is an example of uparasa, or imitation.

One devotee said, "My dear Govinda, here is a nice flowery bush

in Kailasa. I am a young girl, and You are a young poetic boy. After

this, what more can I say? You just consider." This is an example of
uparasa, caused by impudency in conjugal love.

When Narada Muni was passing through Vrndavana, he came to

the Bha��iravana F<:>rest and saw in one of the trees the famous par­
rot couple that always accompanies Lord Kr��a. The couple was imi­

tating some discussion they heard upon the Vedanta philosophy, and

403

The Nectar of Devotion

thus were seemingly arguing upon various philosophical points. Upon

seeing this, Narada Muni was struck with wonder, and he began to
stare without moving his eyelids. This is an example of anurasa, or

imitation.
When Kr�!ia was fleeing away from the battlefield, from a distant

place J arasandha was watching Him with restless eyes and was feeling
very proud. Being thus puffed up with his conquest, he was repeated­
ly laughing. This is an example of aparasa.

Everything in connection with Kr�!ia is called ecstatic devotional

love, although it may be exhibited in different ways: sometimes in

right order and sometimes as a perverted reflection. According to the

opinion of all expert devotees, anything that will arouse ecstatic love
for Kr�!ia is to be taken as an impetus for transcendental mellow.

Thus ends

the Bhaktivedaata summary study of Sri Bhakti­

rasamrta-sindhu by Sn1a Riipa Gosviimi.

Concluding Words

Srila Rupa Gosvami concludes by saying that Bhakti-rasiimrta­
sindhu is very difficult for ordinary men to understand, yet he hopes
that Lord Kr��a, the eternal Supreme Personality of Godhead, will

be pleased with his presentation of this book.

By rough calculation it is estimated that Srila Rupa Gosvami
finished Sri Bhakti-rasiimrta-sindhu in Gokula Vrndavana in the year

1552. While physically present, Srila Rupa Gosvami was living in dif­

ferent parts of V rndavana, and h�s headquarters were in the temple

of Radha-Damodara in the present city of Vrndavana. The place of
Rupa Gosvami's bhajana, execution of devotional service, is com­

memorated still. There are two different tomb-like structures in the
Radha-Damodara temple; one structure is called his place of bhajana,

and in the other his body is entombed. Behind this very tomb I have

my place of bhajana, but since 1965 I have been away. The place,

however, is being taken care of by my disciples. By Krwa 's will, I am

now residing at the Los Angeles Temple of the International Society

for Krishna Consciousness. This purport is finished today, the 30th

of June, 1969.

"Chapter 9

This book is espec}ally intended t� hdp establish eternal religious
principles for the benefit of �11 human hejngs. 'fhe text is flooded '
-, .. -r

with nectarcan stories, philosophy-anJ poetic verses about Kr�IJ.a and

His pure devotees--all taken dtrectly from the Vedic literatures. It is a
summary study of Bhakti-ra�amrta-sindhu,

which was written in

Sanskrit hy Srila Rupn Gosvami, the chief of the six direct disciples
of Lord Caitanya Mahiiprabhu. Lord Caitany<', who appeared in India

500 ye""S ago, is revealed by Vedic scriptures to be an incarnation of

God in the role of His own devotee. He and His· followers are thus
most authorized to teach us how to become perfect in spiritual life.

The subject matter is love of God. The basic principle of life is that'·

we all have a general propensity to love someone. At the present

·

m0rncnt, human society teaches one to love his country or family or

his personal self, but there is no hformation where to repose the

loving propensity so that everyone can become happy. That missing
point !s God, or Kr�IJ.a. The Nectar of Devotion teaches us how. tQ

stimulate our original love for Kr�IJ.a and how to be situated in that
po�ition where we can enjoy our blissful life. The presentation of this
authoritative information about the Supreme Personality of Godhead,

��I]a, and our relationship with Him is simply the· mercy of J:Iis pure
devotee, His Divine Grace A.C. Bhaktive'danta Swami Prabhuplida,
'the spiritual master in disciplic succession from Lord Caitanya ·who

is distributing the science of Kr�IJ.a throughout the world.
